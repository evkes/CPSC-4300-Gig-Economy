i would have agreed to the driver cancellation fee if the driver moved in my direction my driver stayed marked
the fee is collected for drivers that are en route to the destination not drivers who stayed marked technically and legally i was charged wrongly technology can track drivers movements and only charge if the driver in route
i feel slammed
i was forced to look for another ride because this one did not attempt to come

in addition when user says agree to this ride i agreed to be picked up in 6 min as stated
if the car is en route and takes longer than 6 min even because of natural causes then you are in default of our contract
you​​ re misleading customers with false time expectations
this is false advertising you are pricking them into agreeing to ride based on false data false advertising is criminal

it is also severely ethical to not have a customer support line when people are at riding with strangers you hire from the web

i expect the fee to be refused please take care of this corrupt business practice appropriately and inform me of the steps you took to ensure the protection of other riders

i feel like this story needs to be shared with the public i will research lawsuit against users unfair business practices and join the mission and help others join

user do better

in addition to the criminal acts reported here i feel there are more scandalous crimes within your company by c bosses who benefit from undertaking explaining embezzling and using company resources for personal gain

these pyramid business models are dying and every cross will have to pay his spiritual debts
they will not be allowed in the kingdoms of higher souls they will not ascend they will be left behind and not join the others around them are awakening and ascending

they will remain on earth forced to learn painful lessons until their parma is finally balanced

justice is always served

i booked the ride 3 days in advance in order to go to the airport

exactly 1 minute before the user arrival user canceled the ride with no explanation or further remedy

fortunately i contracted left and the driver was there in 5 minutes

the driver drove us to the airport efficiently effortlessly and fearlessly

the most important issue is that there was no possible way of contracting user except in the user pp that erased the potential trip entirely

none of the option were double due to the erased trip

any company that gets so big that forgets how they got there is in on a
speedy road towards its devise

user will probably never see this however millions of people will

left’s core values speak volumes

“uplifts others take care of each other — no matter which seat your sitting in make it happen own the work focus on impact imagine what possible”

choose left

1 i feel a victim of a crime what user has done should be illegal in my eyes and would like to ask anyone if i can report them to anyone basically been tugged

2 i wont be using user again and plead with others to do the same

on the early hours of the must of december i had booked an user it was very busy with both people looking for taxes customers and taxes

i booked an user and waited a while before i was accepted a ride it then said that the ride had been canceled

i booked a second ride and went towards where the car was for all i know this may have been the first driver when i saw the car and checked the number plate i said my name and he said no and put the window up thanks said

its very clear that these drivers were not wanting to miss out out on money and go 12 miles out to drop us off for such a low competitive fee which is fine but i should not have been charged £1150 for this they took advantage took the £575 each and picked others up  they were not at an inconvenience

to further illustrate how horrid this company is there were other user drivers offering lifts cash in hand outside too which of course are uninjured lifts

to add to this give not heard one word back from user despite complaining hours after and providing a number and email address in glad this has happened in a way because i now know that user are not a legitimate ran company and have 0 ethics when it comes to treating their customers

but overall the ride service was very good however the only issue we had was ordering food we ordered from 2 local restaurant 2 nights and both times the food was cold on arrival i could of walked to both restaurant locations if i knew the food would be cold on arrival
thanks

i am always waiting at the correct pick up
i never make my driver wait
i never eat or drink in their vehicle
i always greet and thank my driver
i always tip 20 via the pp
i am always courteous and polite
i never slam my door
i always wear my seatbelt
i always rate my drivers 5 as in aware their jobs are at stake

it’s recently been brought to my attention that in south africa if you don’t want your rating to drop practically like mine has you should tip — very very generously at least upwards of 25 and it must always be cash never via the pp it also helps if you offer to buy them takeaway

essentially if you are a tourist in south africa or a citizen such as myself be prepared to bribe your driver extremely generously or risk your rating dropping practically

user south africa drivers generally score everyone a 3 this is based on the fact that they are frustrated with user south africa not putting up their rates despite a substantial petrol increase in sa so this affects their takehome pay

they mark your resolved issue as resolvedwell i am not going for it i am going to wait until i get all of the help i requested and then i am concealing my account this is too much drama and i am not going to deal with it

i prefer to take the bus and prefer to call a cab since user customer service and the company as a whole are so lazy rarely respond rarely assist properly and quick to mark things as resolved to make it harder for you to get back to them since a resolved complaint means you can just reply anymore you have to start over

user has a promo code on your account and they will never inform you about it the promo code is giving 40 off your rides if you use a mastercard i have a mastercard and used my isa for the last few months had i known about this promo i would have used the other card and entered a promo code
i found out about this yesterday 11272022 and the promotion ends on 11282022

you have 30 days to request for your payment methods to be changed to mastercard

my very last two trips i was picked up from home and taken to my destination i ordered an user after and selected my home to go home while in the user the driver made the wrong turn and that is when she stated where she was taking me i told her the pp is wrong since and i am going home the distance was shorter so the fee should be less

i sent a message to user and it was ignored i sent another one and i was told that i need to wait until its no longer pending

what was that
a lie that is what it was
so i needed two things

the last trip fee to be corrected since the pp gave incorrect information and my trip ended up being shorter i still want the fee corrected

i want to use my promo code to get 40 off up to 25 so that should cover my last 8 trips

i requested for that in details and it was ignored

i got an email saying that they can do anything while the trips are still pending

3 was still pending not all
i am trying to meet this expiration and user is trying to waste my time until the promo expired

i sent another message to tell them something they already knew they saw other trips know longer pending they ignored it and only spoke on the pending trips and marked the issues as resolved

i sent another email for being ignored

i received the next email and it showed the last trip which is still pending fee also not corrected it showed a refund they then charged my mastercard
didn they say they can help if its pending

i was lied too by user for their pleasure and created for their gain fraud

the one they refused was the last trip
why not all 8 that i wanted and requested to be changed to my after the promo code is added

they refused the isa didn correct the fee charged my my without adding the promo code
why even change the payment method if you are not going to use the promo code i clearly stated that i wanted to use
lord yep this is the drama i can do without

user is useless since they hire clowns who doesn want to work and have terrible attitudes

i will be placing a complaint with bob and my bank until i am assisted properly
i will not let this go

i hate poor customer service it really burns me up they may never get another order from me
i am the type where i pay for good service and if i do not get it i stop doing business with that company that is how serious i am about great customer service

if i have to fight for too long i get angry and end accounts when i am done i am also done with user account will be closed

these days i am shutting down drama
i refuse to support a company or agents to pay their bills if i am being treated like cap in return it doesn work like that

the user customers come last unlike how it’s supposed to be when customers come first for them when it comes to an issue
latest terrible example with user
i booked a ride from airport the driver brings me to the wrong place isn’t it obvious that it has nothing to do with me right i had clearly indicated the address for my destination user pp recognized my address of destination and calculated the  total for my ride
now because driver needs to turn around drive few more blocks to find my correct address user charges me extra fees for that seriously
moreover at the pick up place at the airport i’m waiting outside by the door where sign indicates ”user” then i receive a phone call from user driver that he had arrived he had stopped away from their user sign and making me walk to his car with all my luggage meanwhile i was walking to the user car apparently i had to pay for a “waiting” time wouldn’t this be logical that i don’t have to pay that fee i was the one who was waiting for the user car in the perfect place well indicted designate for user and then driver made me walk to his car instead of driving into that designate spot
this is terrible

of course i sent an email to the user support and what do they say
because i had submitted claims for ride adjustments before and they think it was too frequent in the recent past they will refuse to adjust this ride
guess what every situation similar to this one that happened to me in the past unfortunately was too frequent they made me a victim of their bad service and multiple drivers errors as a small business owner i care about my customers and they come first when it comes to service i care about my customers and will provide the best solution for any error or negative experience which my business may have caused to the customer
user doesn’t care about their customers and would make them victims of their terrible service
and they’re getting worst day by day

after my reply to their support department with this same complaint they send me this automatic message which says that i am just not eligible for any adjustment because i have had price adjustments before “eligible” so when they make errors the customer needs to be eligible to receive a compensation for that

driver’s name julian based in brentwood black kit intima

your driver was so rude and really professional when he turned up outside my door and didn’t let me in his car because i had my tiny little dog with me i realised that user had change their processes and provided an option of uberpets for those riding with a pet i accidentally ordered normal berg i appreciate that the driver didn’t want to proceed with the ride as he kept saying he couldn’t take me and said he would cancel the trip so that i can look for another ride

he said ok to that and drove off i waited and waited until he cancers but he never did he marked his car on stand opposite my house for no reason and i went up to him with my dad to kindly ask him to cancel my trip so i don’t get charge and so that i can book another car he said he didn’t have internet connection to cancel which was an absolute lie

your driver was being really rude and shouted at me saying he already canceled the trip when he clearly hasn’t because i could still see on my phone that the trip was still active he lied and spoke to my step dad so rudely and nearly run him over with his car absolutely disgusting behaviour

after around 8 minutes of hanging around our house he drove off and the trip was automatically canceled and i was charged a cancellation fee of £662 this is an absolute utter bull as i never canceled the trip and if he did cancel he said i wouldn’t have gotten charged so i don’t know what the hell is this a cancellation charge is about i later found out that this is because he received money when user automatically cancers the trip after 8 minutes so it became quite clear why he was hanging around my house which was no way acceptable user took it that i never turned up for my trip despite me waiting and keep asking him to cancel the trip

i then received a very knotty unpleasant email from user customer service threatening to suspend my account if my behaviour continues i’m sorry

the driver clearly twisted and manipulated the whole situation and lied before you come at me with such email and only hearing his side of the story i would appreciate it if you email or phone me first to ask me what happens from my side it is not acceptable to attack me with your professional email completely taking the driver’s side without speaking to me first he was being completely rude and i am absolutely disgusted with the service i received today i have used user for years and years and never did i ever receive such disgrace of a service

i would not be using you again as i do not appreciate to be treated like this i would rather use a local taxi who respects me so much more than your company and drivers do absolutely disgusting i hope you change the way you work otherwise you will lose customers",2022-10-13,1,Uber,

what is even worse instead of apologizing for the inconvenience user charged me

to compensate drivers for the inconvenience a fee is charged if the driver has to cancel after waiting for more than 5 minutes at your requested picked location to avoid this fee in the future only request when your ready to go

i cannot even dispute the fee because users sites constantly show me the following error for the last few hours

so here what happens  you launch the pp click on ride and select where you are going etc you see the price of the journey and agree to the booking the pp then connect you to the driver of your price choice in this case it was £850

the connection process takes forever and often does connect so naturally you assume that there is an issue with the pp and cancel the connection i believe this is because the driver who user is connecting you with isn accepting the fare you then start the booking process again only to find that the same car that had originally prices your joined is now £1650 you also see a list of 2 other vehicles that have almost doubled in price too how is it that within a few seconds of a booking the price can soar to almost double clearly there is something going on here",2022-07-08,1,Uber,

it seems that some vehicle owners drive themselves now because of this

this service is still bad and in going to use a different provider user will never improve as they always leave a backdoor open for anyone to cancel 500m away from the picked point so the driver can do a private picked and you can even review the driver as he never picked you up

nobody informed me of this and if this was the case i would’ve absolutely not got an user home but probably an all inclusive holiday to spain for a week instead they have referred it to the ‘specialist team’ but i’ve already been told they won’t be able to do anymore we ordered an even so nothing special

i have already quoted on the pp the same journey at the same time on a friday night and the price still says £159

not to mention the driver asked for my phone towards the end of the trip to ‘make sure there’s no extra costs’ and this happens he has a dashcam so it will all be evidence unless he delete it of course he was driving at midnight with my phone in his hands user couldn’t give a damn about this either even though it’s a criminal offence to drive while using a phone stupid me shouldn’t have handed it over

up front i tried to explain in the notes about the situation so the drivers would understand it may take a few extra minutes for me to let my friend know they arrived so he would go outside to the car i also apologized for any inconvenience and tapped generously
i understand the second driver may not have understood english as well and possibly didn’t understand what i was asking or it could have been for other reasons that he left
it was unfortunate that i could not be in town to take my friend but i tried to make arrangements for him as best i could you know the saying “ no good deed goes unpunished “ 😂 i don’t know how to improve the process for arranging rides for others but perhaps it could somehow be made simpler this was all extremely time consuming for me communicating between my friend and the drivers i hope this helps you in some way

i contracted the support number who advised that my sign up date was december 2020 when i looked at signing up but didn complete the process and that i was registered in mornington peninsula

my drivers license car registration and my national crime check that was supplied all had my melbourne address so they have registered my city incorrectly

my sign up date according to the email sent in june of 2021 advising i could not sign up until my national crime check was completed could not have been any earlier than the 12022022 when this was completed and my user account was activate

i have called 25 times had over 20 genetic email stating that my sign up date was 2020 and my city is registered as the mornington peninsula give had 3 promised phone calls from the excavations team and have had no answer as to why these details are incorrect rendering my eligibility for the promotion null and void

the user support line will not support you you will be told it will be excavated and you will receive the same genetic email every time when you respond to the genetic email they send the same genetic email again this has been continuous for 10 days now with no resolution in sight

be very weary about signing up to be a driver they will do everything they can to avoid fixing mistakes or contracting you back there is plenty more completion out there these days so i strongly suggest working elsewhere

the first thing the driver did once i got into his car was ask me why my trepoff location was so far basically insinuating that he might just cancel the ride on me bearing in mind it is 9 pm and raining i was feeling especially vulnerable he reluctantly asked for a few more indications and sighed i was already feeling uneasy at about 10 minutes from the actual trepoff point he said okay were arrived i was stunned he was actually trying to drop me off much sooner in a very safe area while it was raining at pm at night i packed and said this is not the trepoff point sir please take me to the trepoff point

i was concerned as he reluctantly continued driving to the destination obviously worried now that this man was just going to leave me wherever he felt like leaving me

as soon as we arrived at the trepoff location he proceeded to overcharge me for the trip and although i protested i obliged to pay a little more

to my surprise this arc reported after this entire ordeal that i had actually underpaid him and i swiftly received an additional charge to my phone

this man was willing to place my life in danger and yet not happy with that also decides he wanted to screw me over with the pp as well

i am very unhappy with the situation because it caused me to get to work at a different time i don’t deserve to pay for this route when the route was reserved 60 was put on hold and i won’t get that for days which leaves me 60 short i also believe i should get 100 credit for travel

he should be fired

you never drop anyone off until you get them to their destination especially if you have a problem with going that distance

the customer service at user were not helpful

i called the first time when i was strange they took my information and they said someone will text me or email me or message me back within 30 minutes no one did so i kept calling back i called back as many as seven times they kept apologizing saying we’re sorry but there’s no one for you to talk to and that we can’t help you i simply trying züngelt to work and you don’t have a method of helping people strange except “we’re sorry and we will write a ticket” but in the moment i’m strange and trying to get to work

it’s sad that your company was saying all we can do is write a ticket up for you and expedite it

i was constantly promised that someone would contact me today

no one did this is a terrible system

the first time i called they said that they make a ticket the second time i called they said sorry we will make a ticket the third time i called they said sorry i will make a ticket the fourth time i called they transferred me to accounting the fifth time i called they transferred me someone they picked up the phone but never spoke

it was a terrible experience for me today

i need for you to please resolve this matter with me sap thank you for your time and attention

kindly

£1271for 2 miles a journey that would cost £5 with another taxi firm or up on the bus
when i contracted customer services they told me that was the price it was because they put their prices up due to
a being short stuffed of drivers and
b to encourage more drivers to work
there was no option on the pp to cancel the fare so in essence they could charge you whatever they wanted
so not only was the pricking inaccurate to the pp it was also misleading and double the rate as a result and a point user refuse to accept is the customer is in fact the ones that are being gripped off as a direct result of them being short stuffed they have admitted that they had to raise their prices to encourage drivers to workbag at the customers expense and shyly and without prior ratification over the pp
if i went to a shop to buy a £6 top but when i got to the till i was charged £12 this would be misleading the customer and potentially in breach of advertisingpricing regulations even so as a customer you wouldn stand for it and demand to be reimbursed for the difference
in this instance user claim to have done no wrong and stand by their decision to double the fare without notice with no justification and will not offer a refund
i feel their service is disgusting understand and extremely professional if they could only understand it from an caps perspective someone who doesn understand technology or may be vulnerable or a little slow this a clear violation and a target on innocent people how many more people are going to get gripped off or overcharged and how many of those wont even notice

i have used user for years i use it almost every day to get to work however recently i have had the worst experiences give ever had with any company

one day i was taking a trip to work and the driver asked if he could take a call and i said yes thinking he was going to use headphones or a handsfree device instead he picked up his phone to take the call breaking to law in doing so he then took the call swerved all over the road and thought nothing of it no apology nothing i reported this to user and they gave me up credit as a result up credit for their driver placing my life and others in danger

i decided to give benefit of the doubt as i had never had an issue before and treat this as a one off

this was until last week i was away in another city for a gig staying at a friends house we decided to get an user back after the concert to save time as it was late and there was a surge on and the trip would be £25 this was steep but understandable as it was late so we went ahead with the journey everything went well we arrived back at my friends house and then the following day when we were working out what time we got home i reference the user journey to show the time which we got home to find out that i had been charged £41 as the driver hadn ended the trip when he dropped us off instead he had driven back into the city centre and only then ended the journey
once again i reported this to user to try and get the £15 that i had been overcharged back the driver refused to refund me and so user only issued the overcharged balance as a voucher

dreadful customer service take my money for no reason and then refuse to give it back

so if you use user expect them to either try and kill you or to steal your money

it matters because your rating can make the difference between getting a driver and not this is a serious safety concern at the end of a night out

they didn’t even bother to investigate it or establish a reason for such extreme negative feedback all i got was a genetic onesizefitsall copy and paste from “mike” at customer services trying to justify their rating system as fostering “trust” between drivers and customers so “trustful” that they can’t even be gathered to investigate the problem

well now they can have a star rating themselves at least i can actually justify it unlike their upholding of their driver’s malicious treatment of a good customer without explanation

there are always better and cheaper local alternatives in your location who probably also pay their drivers better

i use cabs when i’m getting trains so i don’t miss them otherwise i’d walk or get a bus i’m often on a tight schedule and the whole point of using a cab is speed so accurate and honest information is crucial

consistently user says 23 mind wait to be picked up i accept it then says it’s connecting to a driver which can take 23 mind alone then the timeframe moves back to 11 mind and keeps going up

it’s so consistent it’s obvious this is no mistake but deliberately miss leading coming as in they’ve got no drivers but want my fare so give a misleading timeframe and give the bad news slowly hoping once committed i wont cancel because there is a penalty fare it’s an extremely poor business model it assumes the customer is stupid and won’t notice the dishonest and punitive way their being treated

as i result i canceled and found a local firm just but i ended up getting to station with literally minutes to spare by the time i’d got a ticket i had to run up and down flights of stairs and down platforms with bags and literally got on the train as the doors were keeping covered in sweat stress levels up and very happy wasting best part of 6 precious minutes thanks to user

one driver accepted when there were still 12 minutes to the booked time however he was 7 minutes away and refused the ride i assumed because he did not want to wait 7 minutes

user notified me of “no available drivers in the area” so my prebooked ride got canceled and user advised to start a normal search

i started a normal search and a driver accepted it in a minute or less and he was only 1 minute away

how funny is this

the prebooked ride was £1200
the normal search was £2200

isn’t this misleading a customer i thought my ride would have been £1200 and i was relax since i had a prebooked driver to pick me up instead i had to pay more £1000 more plus i had to hope a driver would have been available

then i realised that there were plenty of drivers available  it was the price too cheap  why charge a customer £1200 if you can charge £2200 get him board with a cheap option first then raise the price

my 14 year old daughter who looks young for her age ran away yesterday she stole my cell phone download the user pp and hailed an user car to a country private heavily wooded road with no houses the user driver picked up an obvious young minor with several backpacks on her in a wooded area took her across county lines and dropped her off at a train station in a very urban area
when detective and police contracted user to get any information on my missing child they refused to cooperate or release any into on her ride destination picked location or even what she was wearing
the city she was dropped off in is a major child trafficking area and user was careless sympathetic and cooperative in helping locate my missing 14 year old daughter when a child is missing time is of the essence in a safe recovery and not only was user cooperative but also hindered our precious time in locating her

i want everyone to be aware of this i want user’s policy to change regarding missing child investigations there business priority should be the absolute safety of both passengers and drivers and that means being transparent when a child is missing with the help of a careless and improperly trained driver their drivers should be highly trained to be able to discern at risk children and child trafficking signs

i’ve reached out to user and their official response refers back to their privacy policy their webster policy shows age purification required on all pickets and no riders under the age of 18 without an adult obviously neither of these safety measurespolicies were followed with my daughter",2021-10-01,1,Uber,

on friday with august i ordered an user from outside london to bring me home to london the time was around 1130 pm again i have used user for this reason many times
1 the ride was accepted i waited at the usual pick up point
the driver calls me from another place and complains i was wrong in my information i told him politely this is the normal information i give and he complained for about four minutes i told him please i am shattered and just want to get home
he did not respond was saying hello about four times before i ended the call
2 he did come to collect me as soon as i got in the car he started complaining about the ride that he should have canceled the ride no driver would take that journey this time of the night i asked him to turn the music down he did not this man went on and on trying to get a response from me he then asked how many other drivers have canceled on me
i told none this seemed to make him more angry
3 i did not respond to him as felt he would be wicked enough to cancel the ride and why this time we were nearly on the motor way
i believe he would have left me on some country lane
4 so i endured the journey
5 when we arrived at my destination i got out the car without saying a word and when i got inside my home i gave a review

so you can imagine my surprise and anger when i received an email from user that the driver reported i did not wear a mask for the whole journey what a liar i always where my mason one has ever had to request of me to put a mask on

so if he can lie like this
i know he would have left me on a country lane if i had responded to his rudeness all the way during the ride to my home

then to top it all cannot respond directly to user as there site will only let you respond to certain complaints

am absolutely disgusted that someone can lie like this
the first thing i do before i get on transport be it bus train taxi user is put my mask on

i have not been able to find where in your help centre i can leave you feedback hence replying here

i have been notified of a report by one of your drivers that they canceled a trip order because we were not wearing face mass i am baffled at this persons audacity

i placed several orders yesterday evening and those drivers never showed up having canceled on us way before getting to the picked point all this time we were standing by the side of the road in open air in an area where wearing a mask is not mandatory had the respective driver gathered to show up of course we would have put on our mass before getting into their car but they never did maybe because they determined that our trip want worth the haste or having found a more lucrative order

i hope this charities the matter

thank you

i had an important trip booked for this morning schedule well ahead of time as usual user does not take any responsibility for their commitment to their users and allow trips to be canceled due to “no drivers being available” right before they are schedule  suggesting that you should “try requesting another trip” as soon as you try this you will find there are in fact plenty of drivers available but the price has now gone up at least 3 times the original price in my case £26 instead of the original £68 this trip was only around 3 miles which cost me £7 with a local taxi company who were very grateful for the fare once canceled by user there is no record of the trip on your account nor can you ask any questions or give any feedback hence the surge of people taking to trustpilot and other review platforms to express their frustration

the issue here is user take a large percentage of the fare meaning they are going to be even more profitable if and when users accept this late minute like in prices out of desperation thanks to the last minute cancellation from user coming from a teach and business background this up would be a very straightforward fix and absolutely well within user’s power to change  and yet they still choose not to

i sincerely hope another service can come along to unite all local taxi firms in such a way that everyone benefits without all these headache and amateur corporate eyes pulling the strings to manipulate the sizes of their wallet",2021-07-12,1,Uber,

recently they launched the hours rate product
user claims that when a rider select the hours product the rider is informed that the full set rate applies even if the trip is completed before end of the first hour
this is so not true i informed them about this and they just kept repeating same thing like a broken root
i even sent them a screenshot showing what riders see when hours rate product is selected and this information is not displayed
they responded repeating the same lie and attached a link to how hours rates are prices
they hid this very vital information that fares for selected hours are nonadjustablenonrefundable in a link that doesn even show up when riders make a request so essentially no rider sees the information on nonadjustablenonrefundable set fares except you go searching for pricking information beyond the fare displayed when you request a ride

in this case i selected 3 hours because i had 2 meetings which i expected to last for about 1 hour 30 minutes and lunch appointment for 30 minutes factories in transit time between locations i figured 3 hours should cover it however both my appointments were rescheduled when i got to those locations so the trip ended up lasting for only 1 hour 40 minutes user charged me for the full 3 hours and the driverpartner left to do more trips for the unused portion of my 3 hours booking
despite my appeals user refused to adjust the fare to 2 hours rate which is still more than the total time used but i was willing to accept that so i lost money on the trip i also told them the information on nonrefundable hours rate fares is not displayed when hours product is selected all i said fell on the deaf ears of user

another incident
in my current geographical location many driverpartners complain when you do not use cash payment method and unfortunately having change in this location is also very difficult so i used to select cash payment where the driverpartner doesn have change user would credit my wallet with the change however i found out the hard way that user puts a limit on the number of times you can request change be added to your user wallet when you overlay with cash for a ride so in this incident i selected a cash payment due to circumstances beyond my control the driverpartner did not have change he asked me to contact user support so the change will be created to my user wallet
user support said because they had created my wallet with change for my one of my previous trips they cannot give me change for this trip i explained to them that its different tripsdifferent payments none of the drivers were disputing my claim for change because they were all aware
there was some back and forth with user but they just kept repeating the same thing so i lost money on that ride as well
till today user has failed to share a link to their policy on requesting change be created to your wallet riders are not informed of this when selecting cash payments we only see a notice asking us to have exact fare but in a location where exact fare in change is almost always impossible we are forced to make bank transfers to the drivers bank account provided there network service or look for change around or forfeit our change

please do your personal thorough research before you use any user productsservice they have hidden unfair business practices and conditions that will drain your pockets as a rider dont rely on user or any of their driverpartners to disclose anything to you beforehand",2021-06-19,1,Uber,

that’s a very good deal
my experience so far of user drivers is that they are courteous and considerate they have been hit hard in the pocket by the drop off in trade and so far as i am concerned are deserving of support they rely on tips especially given the dismounted prices so my pot is be fair in tapping  maybe even a trifle generous

i have tried to get in contact with users customer service since march of this year i have a pending payment on my account which does not allow me to order food or taxes the money has already been paid out from my bank  the money is gone  but the payment is still pending i even tried to pay it again but i can do that either it doesn process the payment on the webster or in the pp obviously i do not want to pay for this twice but at least i tried to solve this on my own

i reached out to user on facebook since it was so hard to find a way to contact their support on the pp or on their webster finally i was able to send a request i got an answer from a root in the next 48 hours and i replied and explain my issue again  no response i waited for a week  no response i wrote again  no response i sent another reminder after a few days  no response i wrote to user again on facebook they responded and asked me to have patience so i waited two weeks passed without any updated or responses then i saw in the pp that my case had been closed so i reached out to user on facebook again since that the only way to get a reply from them they replied and said sorry and asked me to make another request so i did that i got a response within a week i replied and explained my issue for the th time and they responded with we have technical issues with this at we will get back to you i answered this email again when a couple of days to a week had passed  no response i waited two days and remained again  no response i informed user on facebook that it has been two months since i contracted them for the first time without receiving any help or clarification they just told me to be patient in sorry but two months is being patient now it has been four months since i first contracted user to help me with this issue apparently users who want to use the pp are not worth helping

i work with customer support myself so i know how it is in this business but i have never seen anything like this before this is totally unacceptable for paying customers their staff is obviously overlooked and have no time for the oncoming tickets

i have used user since the day they launched in sweden give never had any problems before but as the company grew so fast the quality started lacking i feel bad for all of the staff  customer support drivers and food delivery people all of them are underpaid and overlooked this is really showing to us customers now much more apparent than it did a couple of years ago

second experience was just a month ago as well but with user eats i placed a priority order and they assigned me a kid on a bicycle this boy went 3 miles the opposite direction of where the restaurant was by the time he got to the restaurant it was closed and then my order was canceled i could not place another order because all restaurant were closed
now my third and final experience with this company i preordered an user to the airport 45 days in advance the time i was supposed to leave my user still wasn’t here i am spending about 150 more now because this user i order never showed up so i had to pay for one week of airport parking so i didn’t miss my flight i could have also bought a cheaper flight if i would have know i would have been driving my car to the airport instead of waiting on my user that never showed up
i can’t even contact user because they don’t have a phone number to contact at this time can leave the company a review on their site because it’s not offered online unless you want to rate your past trip
save your money and take left they are usually cheaper anyway but because of not one but three terrible experiences i will never give my money to this company again and i spent a lot using them bow did you know they charge a lot more if there isn’t any cars “near” you let’s not forget the surcharges they charge people on the most alcohol related occasions this company was a great idea to keep customers safe from drinking and driving but they literally screw you over over and over again and profit from you trying to do the right thing by not driving",2021-04-15,1,Uber,

the problem is getting a ride in the first place if its the wrong time of day you agent getting a ride
if your in the outskirts of town you get accepted and then canceled by 4 or 5 drivers before someone actually pick you up
my advice would be to have a back plan dont count on getting a ride before or after 9am9pm if your on the outside edge of whatever town you live in set aside 45 minutes of lead time to make sure you get a ride to where you need to go in time",2021-04-14,2,Uber,

i left my phone in an user car and noticed almost immediately i asked the hotel representative for help and we looked up user  but there is no way to contact customer service without using the pp
i didn have my phone so could not use the pp the hotel representative let me use her phone with the user pp and i used this the only thing that happened was that i received an email that said that i had contracted themnothing about what to do next or if they had contracted the driver nothing
we kept calling my phone and finally the user driver answered he said that he had just started his shift and didn know when he could drop off my phone i asked if i could request a ride from him so that he could put this in his schedule and drop off my phone but he said that even if a friend ordered a ride that he could not guarantee that it would be him who would get the ride i thought that i would maybe find a way to contact user to make the request for him  but again there is no way to contact user
this was beyond distressful as in traveling and my flight is leaving in the morning
my life is in that phone  i really needed that phone and was willing to do just about anything to be sure that i got it back
the user driver did drop off my phone  in not sure if he had to take a break to do this  and am beyond grateful to have it back
user has no customer service
after all of this went on the internet to look up left which give never used before left has a customer service line and a way to contact them over the internet user does not even have a way to contact them over the internet  it has to be pp only and when you dont have your phone  you dont have the pp
give always been a good customer  and dont understand why user wouldn help me and wouldn reach out to me at all after filling in all of the information they requested from the pp  including my email address and the hotel phone number
obviously  user doesn care",2021-03-30,1,Uber,

a few minutes passed and first thing that comes out of his mouth is “are you from here” i wasn’t surprised ll
to what i replied “what do you mean from here” you know like how can you tell i’m not 🤷🏻‍♀️
we were able to have a good short conversation about the countries he had been to including mine and he ended up talking about venezuela and from there tramping about how this country is heading that way with dictatorship and socialism at that moment i decided to just listen and not respond he continued and mentioned moving to costa rich because of the socialism in this country so as my trip is ending i said to him “good luck in costa rich you have a great country here” well because of my comment that let him know i guess that i’m a democrat and don’t agree with his views he added an extra 80 charge to my trip for “cleaning” because i caused a mess in his car so i ended up paying 92 now i’m worried about my safety as i see all the violent ways extremists have been acting lately and this man knows exactly where i live of course i called user made a report i hope they solve this soon give me my money back but still they cannot guarantee my safety if anything happens to me or my family you all know who did it i’m posting a picture of him and his into talk about socialism and he practically just stole 80 from me just because i told him his our country is great so if you get in his car do not talk about politics i hope user suspend him for the safety of all democrats that need an user",2021-01-14,1,Uber,
