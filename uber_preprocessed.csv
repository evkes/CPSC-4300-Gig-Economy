i would have agreed to the driver cancellation fee if the driver moved in my direction my driver stayed marked
the fee is collected for drivers that are en route to the destination not drivers who stayed marked technically and legally i was charged wrongly technology can track drivers movements and only charge if the driver in route
i feel slammed
i was forced to look for another ride because this one did not attempt to come

in addition when user says agree to this ride i agreed to be picked up in 6 min as stated
if the car is en route and takes longer than 6 min even because of natural causes then you are in default of our contract
you​​ re misleading customers with false time expectations
this is false advertising you are pricking them into agreeing to ride based on false data false advertising is criminal

it is also severely ethical to not have a customer support line when people are at riding with strangers you hire from the web

i expect the fee to be refused please take care of this corrupt business practice appropriately and inform me of the steps you took to ensure the protection of other riders

i feel like this story needs to be shared with the public i will research lawsuit against users unfair business practices and join the mission and help others join

user do better

in addition to the criminal acts reported here i feel there are more scandalous crimes within your company by c bosses who benefit from undertaking explaining embezzling and using company resources for personal gain

these pyramid business models are dying and every cross will have to pay his spiritual debts
they will not be allowed in the kingdoms of higher souls they will not ascend they will be left behind and not join the others around them are awakening and ascending

they will remain on earth forced to learn painful lessons until their parma is finally balanced

justice is always served

1 i feel a victim of a crime what user has done should be illegal in my eyes and would like to ask anyone if i can report them to anyone basically been tugged

2 i wont be using user again and plead with others to do the same

on the early hours of the must of december i had booked an user it was very busy with both people looking for taxes customers and taxes

i booked an user and waited a while before i was accepted a ride it then said that the ride had been canceled

i booked a second ride and went towards where the car was for all i know this may have been the first driver when i saw the car and checked the number plate i said my name and he said no and put the window up thanks said

its very clear that these drivers were not wanting to miss out out on money and go 12 miles out to drop us off for such a low competitive fee which is fine but i should not have been charged £1150 for this they took advantage took the £575 each and picked others up  they were not at an inconvenience

to further illustrate how horrid this company is there were other user drivers offering lifts cash in hand outside too which of course are uninjured lifts

to add to this give not heard one word back from user despite complaining hours after and providing a number and email address in glad this has happened in a way because i now know that user are not a legitimate ran company and have 0 ethics when it comes to treating their customers

in my town waiting time can only be charged after the driver has waited one minute in this case i was already there and the driver did not have to wait at all

user so called customer service chose not to believe me saying that i had made a claim for false waiting time in the past true it has happened before that doesn’t mean to say it didn’t happen again i think some drivers just try to earn a few more cents by slamming customers in this way please watch out for this
user has just lost a customer there are better alternatives to user these days",2022-12-28,1,Uber,1
