My son who is 9 years old was traveling with me. It's a long ride and due to traffic, it took even longer. Sadly, towards the end of the trip, my son threw up (mostly water). The driver was kind enough to hand over some kitchen towels, a grocery bag and also a bottle of water. I promptly cleaned up the mess. There was no spills, stain on the seats. There was some water leakage from the grocery bag which was sitting on the all weather mat. The car had a camera to record passenger activity.","3 people found this review helpful

The price is extremely inflated. You feel bad not to give a driver a tip because you know they are not getting paid even half of what you pay the app so you are kinda guilt-tripped into adding more money for a tip. I recently scheduled a ride to the airport. Since I needed a 430am pick up, I made a 48 hour scheduled uber reservation. The first person who picked it up, canceled right away. Within an hour someone else picked it up. The morning of my departure, 15 minutes before the pickup my ride canceled. And no one else would pick it up because Denver has no drivers. I missed my flight and uber would only give me a 100 dollar credit which was not even worth them making me miss my flight. Once I was rebooked, I took the train to the airport instead.

So I'm looking for app developers to make our own and put Uber and Lyft out of business. It's outrageous, their company will say their take rate is 25%, but more times than not, it's +40%.

Let me start out by saying that I had an appointment with uber back on April 19, 2022 at 2:30am to drive me and my friend to the airport. I arranged for this service 5 days in advance 04/14. My whole appointment time appeared to be approved and ready on April 19. Now, come to find out when the actual day came on Tuesday, April 19 at 2:30am in the morning no one actually showed up. I woke up around 2am and both me and my friend George rushed out in front of Country Inn Suites where we were staying. When I first woke up, I checked my Uber app and accordingly, it stated that my service was good to go and a driver was on its way, when I finally got outside within 10 minutes, somehow someway it mentioned that no driver was available and me and my friend were very pissed.","8 people found this review helpful

I use a loyal user of uber for many years my rating as a driver and a rider was a 4.8. I recently tried to rejoin the driver platform. I submitted the required information and uber held up my application for weeks because my profile pic was under review. When I called to find out, I would spend hours on hold and being passed from on agent to another. Their email responses were canned and they sent the same reply over and over. Lyft approved my application, not only in the same day, but within an hour. I'm not sure that anyone is actually working for uber and they just have some outsourced system in India posing as a customer service. I'm done with uber as a rider and driver. #deleteuber #notsuperpumded","5 people found this review helpful

Every once in a while they throw me a bone in the ballpark of a couple dollars off an Uber Eats order here and there. I have spent thousands and thousands of dollars on these platforms. I consider Uber and Eats the same btw because they essentially are with the same interface essentially and the merging of accounts. My two most recent experiences are what are prompting this review, because I am fuming! First off, Uber Eats. Last weekend I ordered my usual Eats order from my favorite pizza joint and the order never arrived at my door, although it said it was delivered. Now, any other MUCH SMALLER delivery platform including now Fedex and UPS) will require the driver to snap a photo to cover themselves, the client, and the restaurant/ business to ensure delivery accuracy. Uber, does not. Even for Priority members. ","3 people found this review helpful

Caught in the rain late on a Friday evening we thought we'd better head back to the hotel so logged into the Uber app for transport... and to our amazement they wanted $41 (yes FORTY ONE $$) dollars for the same 5 mile drive.

I received confirmation from Uber of my ride and I could even see the driver heading to my pickup location. Upon arrival, the app prompted me to rate the driver and give a tip, which didn't make sense since I had not taken the ride yet.

We had to return our rental car first and then ordered Uber. Upon accepting the trip and cost, I was notified that the driver was en route and will arrive in 15 mins. We tried to call the driver to let him know that we were at the Hertz rental so he can watch out for it. We tried calling him 3-4 times and it kept going to his voicemail which, by the way, was a very unprofessional voice greeting. Finally it showed that the driver was 1.9 miles out and arriving in 5 mins. It was raining so we figured the cause of the slow arrival. As we were watching out for the car, a Ford Fusion driven by John, it suddenly said 4.5 mins away and then the app went back to finding another driver.

The only place you see it is before you even start to book it you have to click a small fine print button that says terms. Why not just clearly explain it in the bullet points under what a reservation entails? That is very scammy. Obvious effort to deceive your customers. And no I’m not questioning having a few…although that is a ridiculous amount actually, but rather your efforts to hide cost in order to make more money. Unacceptable!

Uber does not let you know that your next month's fee is due, they just charge your card. They do not have a customer service that you can contact to ask about the charge. I had to try to find out on my own what the charge was for, and how to cancel it. And when I disputed the charge that's not possible since I ""agreed"" to that monthly subscription. Very deceitful way of doing business. I saved $2.00 for the ride, but ended up paying $9.99 for that discount. I will never use this service again.","

There is no customer service line that is easy to find and when I did find a number they said they couldn't help me because they were for drivers. I asked if I could get some help since there was no option to cancel the subscription on the app and the representative just rambled so I was unable to understand her and it was very clear she did not care. Horrible experience, horrible app, use Lyft instead.","

This is just one of the greediest companies there is, and it's hurting drivers, customers, and not to mention the environment.

All drivers have recently shared my opinion that if vaccinated, a mask is unnecessary. Until now. I called for an Uber and did not have a mask. When I got into the car I was asked to put on a mask. When I said I didn't have one, the driver looked distressed. I offered to call another car or walk. He said ""No, I'll take you."" I did not know he would report me and now I am required to send a picture of myself wearing a mask when I call for a ride. ""Let's go Brandon!"" Lyft will now be the only company I use. Next time a driver complains about not having a mask I suggest that you just get out and call for another. Oh yeah, leave that guy/gal a bad review.","

We had a recent 4am scheduled pickup to take my wife & I to the San Diego Airport to go to our son's wedding in Florida a few days ago. At 4:12am while we were waiting outside on our curb with our luggage we got a message saying ""No drivers available"". We FREAKED OUT as we had an airplane to catch. Uber then removed it from my Uber App like it it never happened. We couldn't get a cab in time to make the airplane so we had to drive to the airport and park there. We did not have time to go to Long Term parking as we were running late DUE TO UBER and we were forced to park in the short-term parking at $30 per day.","4 people found this review helpful

Apparently in small print somewhere I missed the booking fee and the uber driver took the tollway when there were many other route options. By taking the toll there were even more additional charges. My $45 trip went to $60. Then I tried to contact them which they make impossible. All contact is computerized and not personal at all. When Uber started they had great customer service. Now that they have grown, they've completely lost that hospitality. I will not use Uber any longer. Total disappointment and horrible customer service.","4 people found this review helpful

Also, while out in Las Vegas for business we tried to “schedule” an Uber at a set pick up time 24 hrs in advance only to have Todd cancelled as well. Once we called another Uber driver and waited an extraordinary time. When I asked driver why the ride was potentially canceled he said that all drivers cancel scheduled rides cause fares are lower.

I believe it was only 10-15 minutes prior to pickup time that I received a price of $79! Of course, having received this notice only 15 minutes prior to pickup time gave me no time at all to look at other alternatives. I had checked the previous night to get estimates of the cost when making the decision as to whether or not to use Uber. As we believed it was a max of $25, we made the decision to use Uber and never looked further with other options. So we had no choice but to take the Uber ride. I did put in a complaint shortly after arriving at the airport and Uber did give me a credit of close to $20, however, still I ended up paying over double the initial amount quoted. I tried to continue my ""chat"" with Uber to get further discount and they cut off my ability to chat any further with them. ","4 people found this review helpful

The issue with the driver was first he booked the trip. And then he arrived late at the pick up location. And after coming towards us he says that we have to pay more money. We were two people with few groceries that he was taking advantage of the weather and time waiting. He said that if we won’t pay extra he’s going to cancel the trip. He was talking so rude and loud. It was very embarrassing for us. And then he makes the trip start and then when we were ready to go he changed his mind and canceled the trip. And left us helpless. And then we have to book for other Uber.,"6 people found this review helpful

My trip was from Mill Valley, CA to SFO. My driver and the car were great, though I would have appreciated the driver explaining the 5x rate, which didn't happen. I never saw the estimated charge other than the $90 quote. The ride was about 40 min. The charge was $293.45. Uber makes it next to impossible to register a complaint and as far as I can tell, all responses are computer-generated. I worked for hours to find the choice, charges did not match the quoted price. In the meantime, I used some other button to register a complaint. Uber's reply has been that the charges stand as they are. I feel totally ripped off by Uber and will not ride with them again. These charges are outrageous.","16 people found this review helpful

It is not easy to find out how to contact Uber, there are no phone numbers available, so the only way is to do everything online. I logged the dispute and was contacted by Kervin and he said he had passed it onto another department. There has been no contact since.

For more information like hardware and software specifications, please contact me at my contact details, I feel this as a very high priority and severity bug, which needs to be fixed. Thank you.","

                ","Original review: Aug. 1, 2020","At booking, I was given a price range of $13-17 (similar price to exact trip taken the previous day at the same time). Accepted, met with driver on time...no difficulties, no construction, no additional stops. After trip completed, fare charged was increased to $23.25. I was not informed by my driver that my rate had increased, nor given a reason why by customer service, despite several requests for a simple explanation. Misleading and unethical business practice. I used to trust this company, and used them exclusively...but their decision to perform and defend this bait and switch tactic gives me reason to give my business to their competition. Thankful for the lesson.","7 people found this review helpful

I knew something was wrong. Then I decide to take the ride and walk the rest of the 3 blocks since there is no way I can make it for 13.00 or at least 21.00 to my front door. I explained to the driver the issue, why I have to pay so a big difference between my home and 3 blocks away. The driver then drove past my house and I asked him if he can drop me since my original destination was 3 blocks away and he was driving right in front of my house. He stopped and I walk a few houses to my house. Then came the bill. $ 60.00 bucks. ","6 people found this review helpful

Did not recognize my phone number which is the correct number on account. Called twenty times. You can not get through as recording says that number is incorrect. Driver did not attempt to call me which he should have. Was charged cancellation fee plus ride. This is a system that has clearly failed. Initially appears to work but no transparency and no way of really getting through. Discount promised. Didn't see it. Emailed back after receiving receipt. Response from Uber: ""This email is not monitored."". I was a horrible experience not to be repeated. Unfortunately I won't use Uber again.

I also use Uber overseas often. On my most recent ride, there was a new fee called Long Pickup fee, which applies when the driver has to drive a long distance to pick you up. According to what I read online in blogs, the fee applies after a certain distance and it adds up slowly (cents per mile). Uber refuses to explain to me how my recent ride incurred $13 of Long Pickup fee. I scheduled the ride for a later time because there were many options available within 10 minutes away and I needed the driver to arrive in 30 minutes. Fellow passengers, be aware that scheduling in advance may put you at risk of hidden fees that they refuse to explain in details.","5 people found this review helpful

But besides that, Uber doesn't even allow for input of the dispute. They force you to claim something like ""the driver took the wrong route"" before they go and review.

Still haven’t gotten my issue resolved and I’m still waiting for a callback from a supervisor I expect I’ll never get.

My Paytm was linked with uber and I have been taking rides through uber app. One day my ride was of Rs 69 and the ride was over half an hour before and I was sitting at my home when I received message that Rs 174 deducted from my Paytm against that ride. Even after my complaint for the same in uber no one turned up yet and the pathetic thing is there is no one or no contact point from where I can get clarity. Seriously I feel like these online business are like trap for customers and please don't be fooled. Never link your bank or any other payment mode through which they can steal your money.,"4 people found this review helpful

Instead I have been given the run around by their so called support team about submitting a report and following the process. When all that really needed to be done was someone pick up the phone and call the driver and I could of met him while in town to get my property returned. It has been numerous days since this has happened and numerous reports submitted and still nothing from their support team. Unfortunately, I have had to submit a insurance claim and purchase a new phone for 199.00 dollars. Peoples lives are on their phones, time efficiency is urgent in these types of matters. It is hard enough even finding someone to contact if your driver has no number under your trip, let alone them actually trying to help. I will never ride, recommend, or support anything that has to do with Uber.","3 people found this review helpful

Uber overcharged me for a trip I took from Baltimore Airport to Washington DC. I have used Uber in the past to travel this route and was always charged $50-$60. I was therefore surprised when Uber charged me $169.69.

I can say firsthand that driver safety is the last thing on their mind. I got a request to pick up Joe **. Once there I see 6 big built male passengers walking towards my vehicle. I rolled down the window and asked Joe ** to identify himself, and he does. He said Uber told them my vehicle can fit 6 people. My vehicle only fits 4 passengers! Uber Drivers have no idea how many passengers are being picked up. Uber should take measures to avoid possible dangerous situations.","

I’ve had situations with drivers that turns aggressive to other drivers or that they gets mad for requests you make them, even though that’s established within the fares, and once you contact the customer service team they immediately take notes on the matter and compensates you in any way or the other. Also, if you have an issue during your trip, they provides you with tools to get emergency assistance wherever you are.","

My son went to the left side but my wife was there, I told my wife she needed to move to the center. My wife is Vietnamese and has hearing issues. So after telling her twice I grabbed her jacket sleeve between thumb and forefinger and told her ""firm Voice"", ""You need to move to the center so my son can get in."" The female driver turned to me and told me to get. She would not have that in her car. They (uber) sent another car and my son filed a complaint. Two weeks later my son needed to get to a surgeon office for an appointment. The car they sent went the wrong way. They sent a second car but charged me for the driver going the wrong way. If I am to continue to use uber they will have to improve.","

Our emails are only one letter different, so I can understand the mistake. I immediately contacted Uber to tell them that I had never signed up for an account with my email and to delete or disconnect it. I assumed that they had taken care of it, as I got no further emails from Uber. Now I try to create my own Uber account, but all of the other person's information is attached to it, and Uber's customer service just gives me the run-around, refusing to correct the problem, refusing to even UNDERSTAND the problem, and telling me to go create a new email and new account. Absolutely not! - I will NOT allow another person to use MY email address for an account. What part of this is okay? Uber is allowing another person to use MY email address for their account and refuses to correct the issue. What an incredibly lack of security!","2 people found this review helpful

Both drivers were safe drivers, their cars were clean and comfortable, and they readily adjusted their thermostat in their car to accommodate our comfort level. The second driver that picked us up from the concert was able to get very close to the arena exit doors. We did not have to walk very far at all to get to his car after the concert. He was there waiting when we walked outside so we did not have to wait at all for him to make his way through the traffic to pick us up.

The worst experience I've had, in my 2 years of using Uber, was in San Francisco. I waited 14 minutes for a driver who didn't show up. He somehow canceled and went elsewhere, and I found out the hard way. It was annoying, but didn't cost me anything but my time. The overwhelming majority of times I have used Uber were great. Nice drivers who showed up on time, drove safely and gave great service. Most Uber drivers go above and beyond. They are happy to give travel tips to tourists and help with luggage. I always feel safe with Uber as I have the Uber car's description and license tag, plus a picture of the driver.","9 people found this review helpful

They promoted the Uber/Lyft as a good option and a specific pick up and drop off location. However, they did not have any signage or directions to the Pickup/drop off point. I think the idea was great, execution poor. Maybe the UBER/LYFT companies could provide some signs for directions to spot to the venues.","

And the drivers are always polite. I think free wifi along the greater DC area would be especially useful for businesses along the pike to invest in.

You could say it was my own doing that there was only two dollars difference between ride alone of $32.82 and pool rider of $30.84 (already added $2.71 for point to point pickup/drop). So around 14:07 Uber picked me up and drove around blocks, picked up another rider, dropped her off at Target, and picked up another passenger at MGM. I was all over places to save two dollars since Uber changed it App.","4 people found this review helpful

I was erroneously charged a sum of money on my journey to cover the driver using airport parking and picking me up from the airport - he did not use airport parking (at least with no need to collect me) and he did not pick me up from the airport! I have raised this through tens and tens of messages going backwards and forwards to uber, but they just won't listen, keep taking the same party lines and have more or less told me to go away. I asked for the CEO's details to complain to, but they have not and will not provide me with them. The sum I was refunding is meager, but it is the principal! I am disgusted with Uber, the handling of this situation and supposed customer care.","6 people found this review helpful

                ","Original review: Sept. 24, 2019","It looks like Uber has not been able to resolve the data breach issues they have and when confronted with evidence of a customer having unauthorized charges on her credit card from a foreign country, they choose to dismiss it and leave the burden of resolving the problem on the customer, instead of addressing and solving it, as a responsible and customer oriented company would do. Therefore, if you don't want your credit card to be used by foreign riders around the world, it looks like the best option you have as a customer is to resolve it yourself and close the Uber account (since Uber clearly won't resolve the issue).","3 people found this review helpful

We assumed he was avoiding congestion or knew a route to our home that we did not. After nearly an hour we noticed that we were navigating Hyattsville, MD, which is about an hour west of Chevy Chase. We opened Google maps, and he used that, along with shortcuts we suggested to our home. What might have been a one-hour trip home, in view of rush hour traffic then, took at least two.

A month ago Uber disabled my account. I reached customer support and after a few email exchanges, customer support sent me a rude (and offensive) email that I have violated the terms and conditions. I can safely say that this is truth challenged. I have no duplicate accounts, I am quiet as a rider and cooperative and never caused any issues. I asked customer support if there is a mistake and if they can lift the suspension but they ignored my request. This is no way to treat a client. Uber deals with problems because it cannot handle the vast clientele it has currently and makes mistakes, but this is no way to treat someone like this. I believe that TLC should investigate further how Uber is operating in terms of customer support, as well as monitor it much closer.","6 people found this review helpful

But when I cross checked with my trip charges then I was shocked to see billing of 835 is showing on my app. I asked the driver to talk to Uber and check the same but he refused and asked to pay his charge as per his Uber application and write mail to Uber for the claim.

Only amount, date, location is shown in it and same is with my trip detail in my Uber app. When trying to download receipt of this trip it's not opening as Uber Lite is not supporting this function.

The amount displayed was between 27-35 (which included surge). I didn't mind it as I was running late and wanted to get to the destination on time. Unfortunately there was an event taking place at the location and the cops had blocked some of the roads - due to heavy traffic and roads being blocked it took me 50 mins to get to my destination as opposed to 20 mins and to my surprise at the end of the ride the driver told me there is waiting time added to it which I wasn't aware off as Uber doesn't tell you the amount right away. You don't have the visibility as you do in most cabs. You can see the meter and make a quick decision of either taking the ride or stopping it right away.,"3 people found this review helpful

So for a guest in my car to say I need deodorizer that's rude. If I am driving through a green light and it turns yellow one cannot stop in the middle of the street. There is a reason a passenger doesn't have a car. Uber never asks the driver about the passenger reports, so I am quitting. I will never give one of these passengers a ride anywhere in my car. Uber cheats drivers daily, they only hire Asian customer service reps, and the guy who works at the San Bernardino green light is a huge ** who wears a sweater and basketball shorts.

Recently Uber started to charge a so-called booking fee, claiming that this is to support one of a sudden safety initiatives. What am I getting from your safety initiatives? Just another trick to charge customers more. Would love to see the list of Uber initiates they currently do for passengers. Also, there is no transparency about the fee. It should be added to the estimated cost of a trip before a customer orders rather than in a sneaky way of adding after the fact. Just very frustrating because such a reputable company like Uber make its customer feel like fools.","3 people found this review helpful

Uber is too busy stealing from drivers while reducing their pairing. They control your earnings and steal 40% waste of time, money and gas. You’ll drive around more looking for trips than you would actually driving passenger. If you complain Uber retaliates. Uber has made numerous changes to drivers earnings while they collect all the profit including the pools that should count multiple passengers towards your quest. Instead only counts as one trip. You make less than minimum wage and isn’t even worth carpooling to work. Drivers are going on strike for a reason because Uber steals from them. Waiting two hours for a passenger nothing. It’s not even worth it carpooling to work.","3 people found this review helpful

I take a 1 hour drive and they take the money away from me saying that I picked up the wrong person from a specific household to a business. Please tell me what the likelihood of me picking up someone from a house and go in one hour away to a business and we picking up the wrong person is.... Oh you say it makes no damn sense, yeah you're right. Smfh. Uber takes no time whatsoever to do any sort of investigation not even an email to find out anything at all from the driver. They just send an email saying that they took your money and you wasted your time. This is not the only nonsense that I have had to deal with. A customer broke the handle of my car and there was a huge run around with handling that. I will no longer be driving with this unprofessional company and I will be taking legal action.","4 people found this review helpful

The mats are literally matted with cakes of dirt and the seat covers are almost always stained. To top it all the drivers are really unprofessional, they refuse to come up on the pickup point and if they don't feel like executing the ride, the driver ends up calling the rider and asks them to cancel the ride. Hence lowering the rating of the rider. I have had extremely bad experience with Uber at multiple times. I have been dropped in the middle of the road by the drivers just because they didn't have an internet connection to check the maps. The drivers are racist as well sexist and on many an occasion have passed very rude and vulgar remarks.","

Pathetic experience and worst thing I did. Driver was so damn rude and ill mannered and as the fare should have been maximum 150-200, somewhere between which is the unusual fare for this trip on. I paid RS 630+toll tax of 37 and driver telling me I owe RS 630 which was showing for my last trip from Intercontinental Resort to Airport which I didn't took! I couldn't understand WHY I was being falsely accused of having outstanding balance, nor WHY the fare should have been so much. Just 11kms. Quoted rupees more than the fare I already paid!

How is this ok when the trip actually started earlier than scheduled, which was entirely at the driver's will? Now that I did some research, it seems that in 2017 Uber added tons of hidden fees that are controlled 100% by drivers so they had many more ways to get paid more, of course by the consumer who knows nothing all so that Uber didn't have to spend a cent more on their contractor drivers.

The driver is unaware of who they are picking up or even where they are going until the rider gets in the car. I have had questionable riders get into my vehicle and ask to be taken to areas that’s did not feel or look safe. Ubers only consider is making sure you get the rider to their destination and not how to protect its drivers from harm while driving. This company should really evaluate the safety for not only their riders but their Drivers as well. ,"3 people found this review helpful

I found it disturbing that nobody from UBER can be reached by phone, text or email. I think there is enough detail in my review. People need to be able to CONTACT CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS.

However, I am certain that their awesomeness is not a result of the trickle down effect. I know this because, when it comes to Uber's corporate staff, customer service does not exist; literally! Their one flaw that I've observed in every driver is directly the daily of Uber executives. That flaw is poor GPS technology. Nearly every GPS app (including Waze and Lyft) is superior to Uber. This is a problem that would have been solved if the company had a customer service strategy and department worth mentioning.","7 people found this review helpful

It makes for a very uncomfortable ride. I even had one complain the whole time and then make sure I knew there was now an option for tipping.

Uber, oddly enough, has attracted highly qualified, a very polite, drivers who drive Uber to earn extra money. I enjoy that scheduling a ride is simple through a smartphone application. Once Uber detects the local drivers, via GPS, it directs the closest driver who’s available and provides an estimated time to wait, and an estimated time a arrival to your destination. Uber also allows users to estimate the cost of rides in advance. Also, Uber allows the rider to tip directly from the application and also rate the driver. I’ve never had an issue with any Uber driver I’ve used. It’s more uncommon for me now, but every so often I do use Uber.","9 people found this review helpful

I was really upset and cancelled as per the driver's instruction and was charged a 5$ cancellation fee. I’ve been talking back and forth with Uber customer service for 4 days now and they refuse to credit me the fee even though they admit I’m right and apologized for the bad experience. Their reasoning is that too many fare adjustments were made on my account (which were warranted 'cause I was indeed overcharged on a few trips). This completely irrelevant and a completely separate issue and they’re nickel and diming me over 5$. This makes absolutely no sense.

It was the one I downloaded first while in college and the one I've continue to use these past 3 or so years. Some experiences have been better than others but in my opinion the drivers probably have had a worse experience. The rides I've enjoyed the most were the ones when myself and the driver have respected each other's privacy, acted courteously and professional. I have witnessed people trash and throw up all over a driver's car, and that's not alright. I think the thing that has begun to creep into the way I view Uber is all of its negative publicity. Why would I support an enterprise that I don't agree with? It's not like I am dependent on Uber. I can use other ridesharing apps, I can use a traditional taxi, I can even use public transportation.

The Uber driver refused to cancel as he would be penalized, and I refused to cancel for the same reason. To end the stalemate, I was lucky the doctor's office had a stool. Uber is great for when you need a ride and are unable to drive for medical or other reasons. However, Uber does not seem to have any consensus control over the cars people are driving.

The convenience and cost can't be beat. I also often use them for personal reasons over driving myself. With parking rates approaching $70/day in San Francisco, ridesharing quickly becomes cost-effective and eliminates any issues with drinking and driving.","

There are so many issues that I could write all day about, but needless to say their app is flawed and their customer service is a joke. They are not consistent on how much they pay and since I have so many passengers throughout the day it's near impossible to keep track of the details of every fare. But after 2000+ passengers you start to get a sense of basically how much you'll get paid for rides taking a certain amount of time going a certain distance. Uber compensates me different amounts periodically, sometimes it will be a fair amount while other times I feel very shorted, of course I've never felt overpaid... Imagine that.","4 people found this review helpful

When the time for our pick up, with no driver in sight, had come and gone by not just a few minutes but by almost 30 minutes we realized we had to get ourselves to the airport in order to catch our flight. This not only caused a lot of undue stress but a whole lot of money. We had to pay for 2 days of parking at the airport and for someone to pick up our vehicle.

We took Uber to get home, we were little tipsy at that time. I was sitting in front of the car and after five minutes I told to driver that he needs to pull over because I was going to throw up. He eventually pull over the car and I clearly puked outside, the flow of our travel was smooth, the driver was fine. However, the fare was also fine when we got home. Few days later, Uber sent me an email that the driver charged me $80 for vomiting inside his car. I called Uber service to complain but they did not solve my problem. Ever since that happened, I became more careful using this application. Furthermore, I do not have any bad intentions for the Uber company. I am just here to share my experience with Uber to inform other users that they may encounter this kind of scenario.","

You do get directed to their Twitter feed where you can write in your question which is absurd on its face as I have never ever seen a company handle support in this way. And, you have to join Twitter just to do even this. I hate Twitter and find it stupid and useless which is why I used it for a few months years ago and deleted my account. And since I won't rejoin Twitter I cannot get in touch with Uber. ","

Managed to solve this issue. The next issue, I attempted to purchase Uber credit, to be declined. My bank had cash in it, but refuses to accept payment. Furthermore, according to them, I still owe a $1.03 balance for some reason. Speaking of, why am I paying .03 for every dollar I give as a tip? And technical support (if you can call it that) just repeats itself and the directions to whatever issue you have with no guidance whatsoever. Really insulting. Used to be a great service, but now I guess they've decided to rest on their laurels.","

The update to the GPS has caused so much confusion for me and my drivers. Most of the time the address takes me to the back of the building I ask to go. Also this new Uber pool walking thing in the middle of winter is a horrible idea. The whole point of us using Uber instead of riding buses is so that we can get dropped off and picked up at our door not walk two blocks in the cold. And you shouldn't have to pay extra just to avoid walking, I've had drivers cancel either way so we were better off without that update. Uber used to seem to care more about its customers, I wish it would go back to being that way. I've been riding Ubers since the beginning.","2 people found this review helpful

It was frustrating but doable, especially if you were lucky enough to find a buddy to split it with.

Once she got up, the Uber driver returned to her car and drove away, leaving my daughter standing at the curb. Unacceptable. Highly recommend not using over services.

I used the train system instead of Uber, however, someone had used my account several times in foreign countries and edited my personal account. I’ve tried several times to reach someone to cancel/refund my account but keep get redirected to use the “help” link within my account. I’m unable to communicate through the help link because the person whose edited my account has access to it! It’s crazy. I’ve sent a message through “Get Human Services” for Uber to contact me immediately and provided my cell last week - still no follow-up. Uber has no customer services value and clearly shows it. I’m appalled at their lack of services that get so much national exposure/marketing. All I want is to have safety of my personal information and stop others from using it.

I was hit by an Uber driver on August 25th, 2018 in Connecticut while riding on my motorcycle. Although I suffered many injuries, I am alive and am grateful for that. What I am not grateful for is Uber's insurance company that still has not settled on a fair price for my totaled motorcycle. I had a lot taken from me that night and have had zero compassion from the insurance company that represents Uber drivers. I have made numerous phone calls and emails to James River Insurance Company without return calls or emails. It's now going on five months with no agreement on a settlement, and that is appalling. I will be publishing more news about Uber and James River Insurance company on this site and others in the upcoming days. My goal will be to spread awareness about unfair practices that are being used by both companies.","6 people found this review helpful

He contacted Uber to refute these charges, and told them to check the date and time on the picture. Uber said they didn't have that information. Apparently they believe whatever their drivers tell them. He went back and forth with Uber. Finally, I sent an email and told them the driver would have that info, and we would seek legal counsel if necessary. They soon refunded his money. On a Google search, I found out many Uber drivers do this. They often set up their car to show a mess, use the same pictures over and over again, and even have a bank of ""messy car"" pictures they submit.

I remember this money leaving my account because it was a high cost ride, but seriously at best I’m misremembering and only thinking of the official receipt I got from Uber in which case they should write off their mistake or at worst they are double charging me.","3 people found this review helpful

First thing is that Express Pool seems to make you wait 5 minutes before connecting you with a driver. When it did connect me after 5 minutes it told me to walk a block to a nearby corner and the driver would be there in 4 minutes. 4 minutes became 9 minutes, then 11, then 16 and it became clear from the map that the driver was heading to the airport without me.

The drivers go even 1-2 kms off destination route to pick up and drop other pool riders. Kindly understand, this is very time consuming and we don't reach our destination early. Not like the fares are super-low that we have to bear this kind of torturous service. It would be awesome if Uber pool services are far more efficient, in the sense, each following pick up should not be of 5-8 mins of difference in terms of distance. In this way, more people will use pool services and add less to traffic jams. Uber should not just focus on making money but also contribute to lesser vehicles on roads which is very necessary in cities like Bangalore which is overflowing with traffic.

Uber only cares about $ and drivers but does not care about customers at all. First there is not a phone number to reach if you ever encounter any kinds of problems. Only 10% of drivers are actually nice and professional. Uber taking your money when the driver cancels the ride is just ridiculous. Uber should not cut $$ from your account even if you cancel the ride. If our ride cancellations affects the drivers, then Uber should be able to solve that issue for drivers. Customers should not be paying even for a single penny, if they don’t use the ride.","

I had to book and cancel six cabs back to back because driver denied destination and also denied cancelling the trip. And then the funniest thing is after all this UBER blocked from booking any more cab. It's like you go to a shop where the sales guy refuses to sell and then the Owner comes and ask you to leave because you did not buy anything.

LESSON LEARNED: When getting into the car, BE SURE TO CONFIRM your desired destination by exact street address with the driver. Uber's drivers simply follow the GPS in the app and won't ask to confirm. Uber's drivers are stupid automatons. No wonder Uber is on forefront of developing driverless technology... they are practically there already. The Uber app will offer several alternate destinations as you type in the destination address. If you, by chance, tap the wrong one - and don't notice - you'll wind up on wrong side of town. Uber accepts no responsibility. Be careful using its app. Be careful with Uber. They rip you off and you have no recourse.","9 people found this review helpful

So here is the incident: yesterday (10 Aug 2018) I booked a Uber bike and I put my drop location, the same location I always puts whether it’s uber or Ola and before reaching the exact location the driver says, ""This is the location you have put and I will not go beyond this location,"" I told him that, ""You will need to go from another side. This street is closed to get my place,"" he denied to go. I told him, ""If you drop me on my location then you will be paid otherwise no payment."" ","

I had book a trip from Madrid to the Airport, I was showed a fare from low to high, I was ok with it, I ordered the service. Less than 10 minutes before my trip, I received a message from Uber saying that due to congestion and demand (6AM and Madrid was empty), I will be charge 50% or more. I received this message and at the same time the confirmation that the driver was on its way. ","7 people found this review helpful

This company allows drivers to submit fake pictures claiming you made a mess of their cars and will charge you up to $150 extra without even giving you the common decency of a phone call. I was hit with a totally false charge and Uber initially refused to refund me. I did absolutely nothing to the driver or his vehicle yet when this claim hit my email, because Uber does absolutely nothing over the phone, they had already charged me without hearing my side for any details. Please avoid this alleged criminally designed company. They are not worth the headache and definitely not worth your hard earned money.","10 people found this review helpful

I don't understand how a company can be allowed to do business when it treats their customers the way I was treated. I got a promotional code from Citibank AAdvantage credit card services to use a promo code so I can get credit on my first 2 rides with Uber. I had never used Uber before so I downloaded the App and proceeded to put in the promo code. I kept on getting error messages so I tried to get a customer service phone number in the US. To my surprise a company as big as Uber does not offer any phone customer service in the US.

I arrived to my destination much later than expected. He would stop at stop signs and wait half a minute before moving, it was past midnight at this point and there was nobody on the road.

                ","Original review: July 23, 2018","I've been using Uber for years to take trips home from the store. It's a really convenient app for me, especially because I don't have a car. The drivers are almost always nice. I think it's been so rare for me to have a bad experience with someone. Also, probably the one feature I have not been a fan of us is seeing my customer rating, gives me a bit of anxiety. Overall it's a good service. I've almost never had to wait more than 10 minutes too. The prices have gone up but I am thinking (and hoping) this is because they will pay drivers better.","

I never got a screen telling me my total or asking me if I agreed to book it or not. Just that the car was on its way. The car that arrived was a huge SUV that could probably seat at least 8 people (I was alone and had one small piece of luggage and a backpack), and when I looked at the receipt later, I saw that they charged me $150 for this unnecessarily huge vehicle. When I wrote them about it they claimed I submitted a different destination location, which is entirely untrue. And they were so cold as to not even give me a break as a 1st time user, refunding at least some of that outrageous total.

There was a lot of traffic so I didn't think much of the long ride until I started to notice all the cars had New Jersey plates. We were in Hoboken because our driver had obviously taken a wrong turn somewhere. To make matters worse he spoke little English so he could not explain what was going on. At one point he turned onto an entrance ramp in error and tried backing up it. When that didn't work he turned around and drove the wrong way. When we finally got to the New Jersey side of the ferry I received the final fare from Uber at $77! When I filed a complaint they said I had input the wrong address so it's my fault we ended up in New Jersey and refused to refund me the fare. Numerous emails back and forth got me nowhere so I am left having to dispute the charge with my credit card. Stay away from this scam artist company.,"5 people found this review helpful

That is where the trouble started. To help you retrieve your password, Uber has a two-step verification; they send you a four-digit code to your phone. This, of course, is for our safety.

When I checked the Uber receipt, I found the trip cost to be only Rs.204.82/- I contacted the driver who offered to return the money; but later retracted. Uber also said they are unable to help. Uber displays two rates for a single trip; one higher and the other lower but displayed only in the receipt section. You will first notice the higher amount and pay!!! A system designed to allow drivers to take more money.","6 people found this review helpful

How is it that they get paid more than me on a trip. That doesn't make sense. Drivers need to come together and report them or even boycott for a while until they fix the issues we are having and stop cheating us.

Everything seemed fine, paid fare and gave $15 tip which I thought was generous given the extremely short ride. Received message the next day that driver reported that I left an item in her car and she returned it to me resulting in an additional $15 fee paid directly to driver. I left NOTHING in vehicle and she dropped NOTHING off to me. Googled and apparently these fraudulent fees for lost item returns and cleanings that never happened are common amongst Uber drivers to increase their income.

I believe Uber is faking its surges to charge more to customers during masked high demand times (customers pay more when demand is high during surges, however, per my experience there is considerably less demand or enough drivers showed up in the area that there is no reason to increase the rates during those surge times). I will make it simple. The following happened many time so I can tell that it was definitely not an error occasion, but a strategy to increase rates at surge times.","9 people found this review helpful

The UBER company APP is lousy when it comes to scheduling advance rides, furthermore, when the driver arrives before you can cancel, you are still billed for the call. When trying to contact UBER directly, you cannot do it. No number exists for the city in which you are scheduling the ride and no number exists for a one to one contact to explain your situation. The only number is a help option but it does not work for complaints, only for emergencies. Not going to use Uber in the future.","9 people found this review helpful

He even dusted his entire car in our presence before taking off while we loaded our luggages in the cart. However, 12 days after the trip, Uber deducted and extra $80 from my account as cleaning fee. After writing to them and demanding clarity, I was sent a picture of a huge mess on one of the car seats. If my mom or older sister or myself made such a mess, it could not have been hidden.

The next morning they emailed to notify they were correcting my charge to add an $80 cleaning fee! I am disputing this, but the truth is the driver was creating extra charges. I didn't spill or do anything to his vehicle, nor did he advise me of adding a cleaning fee. He complained endlessly during the trip of his late car payment.

You can only book a ride using their app. It does not allow you to review your ride before purchasing it. You are booking a ride unaware that you have booked it. A car shows up, you get charged and if you're not there, you get charged a $5.00 cancellation fee. Drivers are supposed to call or text you when they arrive, but some don’t. They drive off because you can’t find them and you get charged for the ride and another late fee. There are no human beings available to talk to when you have problems. You have to manoeuvre around in their app to send an email to customer service. This company is a money making rip off.

After shopping, I logged in to get a ride back to my tractor 4 miles away. My payment was denied. What had happened, according to Citibank, Uber hit my card 10 times for a zero dollar amount, therefore shutting it down due to fraudulent activity. Finally, as my phone was running out of battery life, and it was getting darker and colder outside, I was able to choose a method they did take. This can happen, and the Citibank rep informed me that Uber does this a lot. Lyft not so much. If you use Uber have alternate transportation set up.

Number was not valid it said. Whatever then even after waiting for long... It was still that far away... It was no use.

On attempt to confirm ride home I had no credits remaining, even after the first ride receipt only showed $6. This left me stranded and having to walk 4 miles home because I had no more payment options. Contacted Uber via email when made it home. They gave me some dumb excuse about an authorization hold on an additional $6 to ensure there was enough on payment method to cover trip. Well first of all, this policy relates to debit or credit card use, and secondly, I've ride many times using gift cards and this never happened.

(I have to add, though, that my driver seemed a bit shady. I wonder if he somehow arranged for the bogus 0.04-mile trip so he'd get more money.)","4 people found this review helpful

The driver said that it must have been given to someone else and did not have the food place in a sleeve to keep it warm. I ordered eggs, grits, potatoes, and sledgehammer coffee. The food could not be reheated as the texture and taste would be affected so I had no choice but to toss it. I send several complaints to Uber who said that they would credit me for the coffee ($6.99 and no credit to account as yet), but I would not be credited for the food. Sledgehammer $6.99, Egg-Straordinary Breakfast $8.99, Signature Chicken Sausage Patties $4.29, Busy Area fee $1.65, Booking Fee $4.99, Tax $1.80. After paying this much for a breakfast for one person, shouldn't the food be eatable? ***GIANT RIP-OFF*** I feel violated as a consumer.","

Then another idiot driver that accepted to give me a ride, he stopped driving.

You used my car to load up three different fares from the airport to Seattle. You charged the riders, and were paid $96 for my time and effort driving them. The only problem is, you only deemed it necessary to pay me one dollar for every three you collected from them. It IS highway robbery.

The following day they indicated an additional charge of 140,000 COP (around $50 US) for damage to the car. They claim the damage was paint on the seat of car and a torn rear seat. I cannot figure out why they think a tourist would be carrying paint. We took a calm ride from Poblado to Laureles and the following day I get this charge. I have been fighting with Uber over this but they just keep saying, ""Sorry we believe our driver."" The driver did provide some images of the damage.

They said after 30 minutes they couldn’t find a driver and canceled my order. I called back and made sure Drivers were available. They said they were. I placed the same order again. $30. Half hour later turned out that McDonald's wasn’t 24 hours and they canceled the order again. Found out that McDonald's doesn’t open until 5. Ok fine. Waited until 5 and placed a new $30 order. After half an hour again they had no drivers and canceled my order. Waited until 6am when village inn was open. Called to make sure a driver was available. Ordered another $30 in food. Again. A driver was not available. I called again to complain. ,"7 people found this review helpful

Watched the car coming on it when it suddenly cancelled and I had to start over at 3:18PM, only this time the fee was going to be $14+ dollars. I had to take a call, and by 3:35PM it was up to $24, but they didn't show the price, I just got the 2.5x normal rate. I could have taken a taxi for $19. And the Airport wasn't that crowded.

Recently while traveling I ordered an Uber to the place I was staying, I notified the driver it was a tricky place to find and even provided extremely specific instructions. I attempted to contact the driver numerous times but had no response. The driver cancelled the trip and I was charged a cancellation fee.

The initial estimated cost was $21.86 and it ended up taking 20 minutes or so. At the airport we were shocked that we had paid $65.91 and the receipt showed a distance of 74 miles, a trip time of 53 minutes and the map of the route was different from the one that we had taken! We contacted Uber and they promptly refunded the extra cost. Very bizarre - I hope this is an isolated incident and that Uber investigates. If the fare wasn't so much higher than expected we may not have noticed.","7 people found this review helpful

However, their support throughout the three years is nothing I have ever experienced. It's predominantly offshore and only app driven. You cannot speak to anyone and the support ""messages"" or solutions are all canned or templates. There is no humanity for ""outside the box"" incidents. I recently had an incident on the freeway while I had a rider in the car. A motorcycle was ""lane splitting"" (in California) and deliberately punched my drivers' side mirror. When I reported this to UBER, they deactivated me and cited I was an unsafe driver. Again, I never had any other reports.","6 people found this review helpful

The card is issued through the Bank of America from the government of the United States and Uber will not allow it as a form of payment, nor will they allow me to use my PayPal account which is attached to said debit card. I find this extremely prejudicial towards the disabled sect, as many of us cannot drive or even afford a car, making ride sharing a necessity.

I ordered it for the first time yesterday on a route that I've taken many times before with UberX. My phone is older, so the Uber app does not allow me to see the fare before requesting an Uber pool ride. However, I'd taken this ride so many times before with UberX and the cost was never more than $50. I figured since Uber pool claims to be up to 40% cheaper that UberX and it's a shared ride, I should be fine. Boy was I wrong! I ordered the pool and waited the estimated time but didn't see the car. I received no phone call either. Finally I noticed the car a half a block down past where I was standing. I went to the car and was told to get out because he had already cancelled. I was charged a $5 cancellation fee.","11 people found this review helpful

I did and they assigned me another driver (not this one) five minutes away. That driver canceled me after five minutes. I ordered another one but he never showed. I ended up walking the 1.2 mile to my appt. I will never use Uber again. They have absolutely no reliability and no customer service. I will try Lyft in the future.,"11 people found this review helpful

                ","Original review: Sept. 14, 2017","I had 4 guests (5 of us total) so ordered an Uber XL, which is advertised to seat 6 people. When I pulled up the order, I had the choice of an Uber X for $15 or an Uber XL for $35. Knowing that there would be 6 people with the driver, I ordered the Uber XL. When the car arrived, it was a small SUV (5 passenger vehicle) and the driver told us to ""squeeze in"". I have emailed Uber numerous times about this issue and have had no luck getting anything but an automated response saying that the issue has been resolved and that I should order an Uber XL for larger groups (which is what I did, but did not get an Uber XL). I have requested the $20 refund for the price difference with no success. It is not necessarily about the $20 - it is the principle. And it is also illegal for them to drive with 4 people ""squeezed in"" the back seat. It was embarrassing to me, as these were out of town guests. I do have 4 other witnesses that can verify the size of the vehicle.","11 people found this review helpful

I LOVE that there is no money that exchanges hands at all. I was a little leery about providing my credit card info when I signed up but I've never had a problem. I've used UBER so many times since then in different places... Like Chicago! It's just so much cheaper than a cab plus the drivers are usually very friendly and like to tell you about different places to visit (if you're a tourist). Recently I was on a trip to San Francisco and used UBER the whole time. Something new I learned about while there was UBER POOL. The driver picks up a number of people at different stops and drops everyone off at their pre-determined destination and it was only $4.99 per trip because you are sharing a ride with others.

My score dropped to 4.85 because of that. Yesterday afternoon I correctly and honestly paid for two seats (me and my spouse), and when the driver arrived the car only had one seat available. When we asked him to cancel the ride, he denied our request multiple times and stared at us in a creepy way.

And so I found myself, yet again, writing another disgruntled email, to try to remedy the situation. Please save yourself the trouble and use a different taxi service.","11 people found this review helpful

Again 3 more times since in Atlanta area drivers accept and call but then dont answer when you say hello and I end up cancelling just to reset my phone to try another driver! Airport trips etc. and I was charged again and again without it being my fault what-so-ever! A few are ruining it for the good drivers! Never get my money back! I am done. Will use Cab services from now on and Uber should guard a good thing because with social and reviews, easy come customers and easy go!

Charge the drivers for being inept or money hungry for a ""better ride"". Don't punished your loyal customers.","2 people found this review helpful

And i guess they even charge the person who cancels. So in a way Uber is making 2 way money. They charged me 3 times the normal charge for a ride where another pooler cancelled the ride. And now they are fooling me saying that since the distance travelled was more than what was entered originally they are charging me more. But actually distance increased because the driver had to pick up another pooler. Now this person didn't turn up. So entire money load comes on me.","9 people found this review helpful

Not only that but I have taken this ride several times and it cost $6, why was I charged $9.30. The receipt even says $6.26. So now I have to request another Uber to get me to the train. That was another charge but it looks like they took care of that one from Friday. ","4 people found this review helpful

I scheduled for an Uber Express Pool on Monday at 4:56 pm - 5:01 pm with a fare for $3.75, which is pretty decent. I had no issues. Because it went so well, I decided to schedule an Uber Express Pool again after work on Tuesday for the same time, 4:56 pm - 5:01 pm. Surprisingly, it was the same price, $3.75. When I finally got dropped off home, I received an email receipt saying I was charged $20.61 for surge pricing, booking fee, the distance and time it took to drop me off.

The most recent issue was yesterday, when I ordered UberPool, however was charged an UberX fee. If you look at my past ride history, I am well aware of how to order Pool vs UberX. The same thing happened to me on 5/1 (UberX instead of Pool), however I believed it was my mistake and did not say anything. Yesterday, however I was very careful. The difference between Pool and UberX is significant and I am frustrated that I have paid so much extra, for no fault of my own. What is worse is that when I wrote to Uber Support, I was given a generic reply where they had not even attempted to fill in the automated blanks, and they would not respond to my messages.","

The driver showed up in 8, and while usually that would be seen as a positive thing, I was not ready to leave yet since I thought I had 7 more minutes. Uber has a feature where the driver cancel the trip 5 minutes after arriving at the destination and it automatically charges the customer $5 even though no service was provided. This happened to me all within the 15 minute time frame I originally agreed upon with the initial Uber request. It's only $5, but it's a matter of principle. On top of this, their customer service is nearly non-existent as they don't even have a phone number to discuss this with anyone. You can only correspond through email which is very impersonal and a massive hassle. I cannot believe how shady they came across with this. ","8 people found this review helpful

Just emailing and then there are more than one person trying to help and then it get aggravating. I think they have the worst service as far as helping the drivers.

When attempting to resolve, the company will state things such as 'we've adjusted a fare in the past for you' coupled with 'your fare is correct,' finally with a conclusion of 'your driver selected the trip in good faith.' I have been an Uber passenger on many occasions and never had a fare adjusted. My fare was absolutely incorrect and my driver selecting my trip is great, however, I wish to not pay a much higher fare for a type of ride I did not select.

Once you contact them via messaging you will find that if you have an ongoing conversation, replies their system is set up to tag next available service rep. Meaning every time you send in your reply, a new service rep has to review all the conversations to get the rest of the customer’s problem. Extremely time consuming on both parts. My wife is presently texting them as I write. I'm not a patient man and have spent two three days going back and forth on a relatively simple question.

I placed the pin exactly where I was standing in a very visible spot on a sidewalk that was easy to access. Watched the driver drive all around me on the Uber app but never coming closer than 3 or 4 blocks. After 30 minutes of this a message popped apologizing for the inconvenience, but the DRIVER cancelled, which now made me late for my dinner reservation. Adding insult to injury, I also saw that they charged me a $5 cancellation fee. I immediately disputed this and after many exchanges where I explained what happened and also pointed out that the driver far exceeded 5 minutes past the 7 minute ETA which entitled ME to cancel per THEIR OWN POLICY, the most they would do is ""promise"" a $5 credit on a future ride.","8 people found this review helpful

All of a sudden the page went blank. I called Uber again requesting Uber again and the charge came up as $38.00 and gave a name of the driver and he was less than 10 minutes away. So I am in the parking lot of the business with my luggage, when he drove in. I waved to let him know I was the one. I am sure he saw me he was within 50-75 ft. away. Without hesitation he did a hard 180 degrees and sped out of the parking lot and was gone, without a word. I was a bit aggravated, So I dialed up Uber again.

However their charging system is unprofessional and unreliable. I am going to have to report lost or stolen due to them. They do surcharges which flash so fast you don't even get a chance to see their charges. They also start charging you for rides that you do not even take or had even requested or even authorized. This is how they get your money and scam you. I wouldn't trust Uber unless it is a once in awhile type of thing, because when you are a continuous customer they drain your account and if you don't watch it closely you could be overdrawn with many fees. Luckily I watch mine. I am going to have to go to Lyft. Hopefully they are better.","6 people found this review helpful

I accepted the ride and was overall happy with the prompt pick up and driver. Later that month I reviewed my charge card and noticed I was billed again by Uber the next day for an additional $13.00. When I emailed and complained the answer was the driver was unable to calculate the price correctly. I cannot believe Uber can charge my card without my consent! The fact the driver made a mistake is not my problem and the agreed cost should not be altered.,"2 people found this review helpful

You will spend more money on gas and put so many miles on your car that you don't even make enough to fill your tank back up and on top of that if there's a rude passenger which Uber does not confirm who the passenger is. They will cause damage to your car and once he reported to Uber they will tell you that he sent it off to an insurance adjuster and I did no longer responsible. Any insurance adjuster will tell you that you have to pay $1000 or more to fix your own car.

I rebooted my phone several times and I still had the same problem. Then I received a message stating that my password and debit card was invalid. So I reverified everything and even put in my debit card again. That was when the nightmare began! I received an email confirmation that the funds were transferred from my account to my bank account. Assuming it was there (bad on my part), I spent the money, only to come home and find out that Uber did not pay my bank!!! So I messaged them several times, and they have changed their story SIX different times!!! I am very fed up with Uber right now as a driver. I loved to drive, but the customer service and how they treat their drivers when there is a payment issue is unbelievable! I need to know where I can file a complaint against them about this.

I had 3 invite codes so I placed an order for a pizza. The total came to 4.99 with my 15 off discount (which I have the receipt saved for it). Afterwards they went into my account and altered it without my knowledge and removed my promos after I placed the order and sent out a receipt for 19.99.

After around 60 days, I received a notice that I had to pay for a car inspection. This is when I decided to stop driving for Uber. So I have two complaints: The first is that Uber is falsely advertising the pay rate for their drivers. How can they keep getting away with this?

First of all I rarely ever drink and I do not drink and drive and I take my job with Uber seriously. 95% of my rides on the weekend are riders who are drunk and my car can still smell like it when they get out. I let Uber know this and that I was completely offended from their accusatory email they sent me. It isn't right how Uber automatically believes the rider and they treat their drivers like crap. This is completely false and a lie and as of right now I can't drive. I have never been in an accident and I also never had an interaction with the police for being under the influence.

They had a link once you click opt in, there's nothing you need to do to have that hourly guarantee. So I tried it and made sure I covered that time now the night of the 8/20. Guess what? They didn't pay me for the difference, they only paid $52.95 which supposed to be minimum of $84, plus what I made before 10:00 pm. They keep on saying I didn't know there was an hourly guarantee which is bunch of **!!! Told them to fix and they never paid me. Watch out drivers!

I've read some poor people actually buy newer cars in order to drive on Uber?! You have got to do your math. Decisions like that have to be done educatedly. I live in Jacksonville, FL where the average rate is .75 cents per mile. Uber ONLY pays a driver while the rider is having the ride to their destination. The IRS values every mile you ride in your car at about 55 cents. That is the cost for gas and wear and tear on your vehicle. Then comes the driving you do to the point where your rider is; and after you drop your rider off to the next rider. Uber does not reimburse a cent for that. So your actual revenue is less than 20 cents per mile. That could be about 2.00 dollars per hour. It's way less than minimum federal wage.","37 people found this review helpful

I told them that I thought it was ridiculous to treat your personal car as a cab hauling people around with all costs of operation including risk on your own back, then UBER taking 25% plus riders fee as their take for virtually doing nothing except using their software. A truly incredible business model though...for them to get rich, not you...ever. No one was ever able to explain to me if it actually made dollar sense to drive, so I took a one month part time challenge driving 70 hours total on some weekdays and some weekends. Don't believe the liars who say they make $1,500 a week or more. They would have to work non-stop to even come close, and even then, the other costs that Uber takes and the cost of maintenance, insurance, gas, etc. would make that evaporate.

I have had only positive experiences so far, except for one instance when a driver tried to scam me. She accepted my request, and a minute or so later, the app status suddenly changed to ""on trip."" I thought this was very strange and assumed perhaps there was a glitch or maybe the driver had accidentally hit the wrong button, so I canceled and requested again. I was connected to the same driver, but surely enough the app said I was on my way after a few moments. Again, I wanted to give my driver the benefit of the doubt and I chalked it up to the fact that I haven't updated Uber yet. However, I noticed that her car was starting to move along the route toward my destination. Interesting. I thought maybe she was trying to turn somewhere, but she just kept going, and it became clear that she was going to take me where I wanted to go without me in the car at all.","28 people found this review helpful

Head meds, crack cocaine - something. The website is even worse. The absolutely least user friendly and non-functional website I have ever seen from a company larger than 5 employees. What's up with that? Then, if you get through all of that, which takes a roughly 2 hour learning curve because the app makes no sense until you start trying random things - it only accepts certain KINDS of credit cards. It wants bank cards so it can presumably drain your bank account at will, but rejects secure cards that limit the damage criminal companies like Uber can do.

A trip which normally costs about $20 ended up costing almost $150 due to Uber's uncapped surge pricing policy. Uber has no city or government limit on prices, meaning that they can pretty much gouge what they want, as opposed to taxis who have rates limited by law. Often the surge pricing does not reflect the reality of what the demand and cost actually are out in the streets, extending beyond the actual ""surge"" in demand in order to add a little extra.","24 people found this review helpful

It was only $14, but when we contacted customer service, Rachelle basically said we didn't put in a promo code so she refused to help us. Not only are the drivers terrible but the customer service is even worse. STAY AWAY from Uber. I tried Lyft after a friend recommended it, and honestly it's 1000x better!

Total was more than $2,500. There were no other fraudulent charges on the card and AE removed the charges and restored the rewards points. As I understand it, there's no way this could have been done by Uber drivers. I expect it is the result of hacking of user accounts in the United States. I was also surprised that AE, which occasionally requires verification of legitimate charges to department stores because of suspected fraud, didn't prevent individual charges of over $900 to go through Uber.","17 people found this review helpful

"Lloyd of New York City, NY",,"Original review: Oct. 11, 2015","I'm visiting NYC and was attempting to get the attention of a taxi driver and a black Lincoln Continental pulls up with a sheet taped to the right window ""UBER"". The driver said he could take me the 1.5 miles to my destination. I told him I'm not signed up with UBER but heard the rates are better than a taxi. After getting to my destination, he told me the charge was $45 plus a tip and I said ""You've got to be kidding."" I asked him to show me how he came up with that and he said he does this everyday and knows the rates. He refused to provide a fare estimate and said the fare was based on what he normally charge. I told him I think his practice is illegal and he started to use profanity towards me while speaking very loud and threatened to call NYC when I asked for the fare estimate.","24 people found this review helpful

"Leo of Sacramento, CA",,"Original review: Oct. 10, 2015","This is a warning to anyone that uses Uber. On October 9, 2015 I used UberX to take me approximately 10 miles, downtown to the auto dealership on Howe Ave, to pick up my car from a scheduled service. My office is located on J street with ample parking in front. I put my pick up location in accurately, and saw on the Uber app that a car was 5 minutes away. I waited on the curb for the next 15 minutes, at which point I sent a text message to the driver. He never replied and cancelled the pickup shortly after. I was notified another driver would be at my location in 5 minutes.","26 people found this review helpful

The background - it's been pending for 4 weeks and they still don't know what's going on. Since they don't have a customer service hotline. They just give any excuses. The background take about 7-10 days but then takes about an eternity. This is the worst experience I have had with an employer. It was a mistake - I shouldn't trust a company who doesn't have a human being to talk to. They said ""we'll take care of it and we'll see what's going on and we'll send you an email."" They never ever did. So I decided to cancel my account.","22 people found this review helpful

                ","Original review: Oct. 8, 2015","I started driving for Uber and have been doing it a couple of weeks. It took a while to get statements showing what I actually made in income versus what the fares were. Uber gets between 33% and 45% of the money, at the higher end on short trips, which are more common. And there is the waiting and drive time when you are off the clock! At least in my market (Twin Cities, MN) you are going to make about $10 to $13 an hour BEFORE EXPENSES. When you factor in gas, wear and tear on your car, tires, brakes, etc. you are likely making about $5 per hour! It is a fun job, flexible, interesting people, etc. But you can't make any money and you are using up your car. Uber is a great deal for the riders, and for Uber! I'm done with it.","38 people found this review helpful

First of all, the exterior of the car was very dirty. The interior was no better, filth and grime was visible in the dashboard area. The car reeked of cigarette. When I asked the Driver if he had been smoking, all he did was fiddle with the A/C vents. After a while, he rolled down the window on his side slightly, I guess to reduce the cigarette smell, but that didn't really help. External heat and fumes came into the car, worsening the situation. I could hardly breathe and I developed a headache. My clothes still smell of cigarette.","16 people found this review helpful

Neither of which were approved on my card. I have been back and forth all weekend trying to get this situation resolved. I have spoken with three different representatives in order to get this resolved. It seems that I am just getting passed around and bullied to a point where I feel as if they just want me to be silent and just take whatever they say whenever they feel like responding back to me. ,"21 people found this review helpful

After 2 weeks back and forth, Uber's decision is not gonna do anything! ALL DRIVERS BE AWARE. UBER IS NOT GONNA CARE ABOUT YOU! It left me with option either to go with my insurance or Uber's, with $1000 deductible. And they won't charge the rider even damage fee... There always will be insurance gap, and this is not right! Uber takes $1 riders fee and 20% from the fare, and when our car is damaged, they sit back and sip the drinks! As a 2 year driver I am very disappointed! For riders, they will say the same thing about insurance. In the end, Uber cashes in the money and won't care about anyone when things goes bad!","24 people found this review helpful

"Tiffany of Baltimore, MD",,"Original review: Sept. 9, 2015","When I started they said I needed an IPhone so rented one through them not realizing there were more hidden fees behind the $10/week charge for it. I added my 32 trips to over $300 and only received ~$50 total which only covered the gas and tolls I spent out of my pocket. Maybe if I'd stayed until the phone was paid off I, as a part-time driver around my full-time job and other responsibilities... I would have seen a profit. As of now I drove all them rides for FREE.","21 people found this review helpful

A coworker suggested I try the Uber app. Trip one, the pick up at the airport, the driver was sitting in the wrong place and expected me to walk to him at the other end of the terminal. Trip 2 a short ride from my hotel was $20, when a yellow cab for the same trip was $8. The driver again stopped midway down the block and parked in front of another hotel. It took him 25 minutes to find me, when the APP showed his car making circles around the blocks nearby. Trip 3 the driver did not know where to go to find Broadway and Lafayette. Uber drivers use their personal cars to pick up a few fares. They don't know the normal taxi protocols, and it cost be double or more for each local ride. Yellow Cabs are still a great service, with professionals who may not have fancy black cars, but have expertise in driving.","22 people found this review helpful
