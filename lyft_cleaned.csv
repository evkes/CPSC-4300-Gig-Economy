driver: nelson
toyota rav4

i tried to help direct him out of a tight driveway and in that moment i got distracted and forgot my large blue suitcase that mr. nelson helped put in the trunk of his car himself.

since the 10th of february i've exausted & tried all of lyft resources to contact mr. nelson to no avail.

not only has this driver not responded to my obvious numerous attempts to contact him but he also never responded to lyfts company's agent app private email.

i don't live there and was on a business trip so i did not have a chance to do a lost & found police report.

the only sentimental thing in the luggage was my sons daffy duck stuffed animal. may not seem like anything important to you but how,why & when he gave it to me is very important.

i've been a long time client of lyft and never experienced such poor customer service from their drivers like in california the lack of leads me to uber.

* check & re-check all your personal belongings
*wear your seat belts and
* good luck!!!

yesterday i booked a lyft shared. when i got in the car, another customer was already inside and on his way to his destination. as i entered the app showed that my ride was finished, and the driver told me later that she knew that. she proceeded to head to the destination of the other customer without saying anything. when we arrived the driver proceeded to pick up the next ride without even considering dropping me off somewhere convenient, so i was dropped off there (even farther away from where i booked). not only i missed the event that i paid for, but also i didn’t get to my destination in la, and was left at a place that i didn’t know. my boyfriend paid me a lyft for 43,70 $ to get back home. never had a disappointing experience like that where nobody cared.
my drive was refunded already, but due to the circumstances, i was kindly asking for a refund or a voucher for the drive home that was paid for by my boyfriend and compensation for me in form of a voucher (danger of the situation, missing event, riding around for 1 1/2 hours for nothing). i also had screenshots as proof.

costumer service dint wants to give any kind of compensation, nor did they understand the situation as it was. they are going to punish the driver, even when it was half of his fault (maybe the app had problems too).
also, they make it not easy to reach out in cases of emergency. that needs to change.

the drivers were quite friendly and nice, but lyft's tricky promotion emails, lyft app cunning setup, as well as the customer service, all those disturbing experiences convinced me why lyft could never make it as big as uber.

*i took my first ride with lyft from detroit airport on 8/8, while lyft sent me a promotion email on 8/9 stating ""75% off 1st ride up to us$12.00/ride""(attached).
*i took another ride with lyft to detroit airport on 8/12, while remembering lyft sent me another promotion email on 8/11 stating ""75% off your next 1 ride""(attached)

seeing my both charges(attached) showing the full amount, i contacted the customer service and was told the coupons don't apply because my 1st ride coupon was started on 8/9 while i took my first ride on 8/8. my mind got twisted so hard: either lyft system didn't detect my first ride on 8/8 and sent out the promotion email on 8/9 by mistake, or the offer was not legit since lyft knew i wasn't able to use the offer because i took my first ride a day before. i wish i am wrong, but how the manager handled my escalation made me believe it's the later logic that lyft is trying to trick the consumer to ride with the discount but in reality it's a different story - it's a tedious process to reach to the customer service, not even mentioning to talk to someone to address the real issue

i'm not going to waste my time asking why the second coupon not applied, since lyft does not care not only the riders, but the drivers at all - reading through the reviews. therefore, just be careful what you are told via lyft emails doesn't mean what you will be offered as is. at the end of the day, life would be better staying away from insincere people and business, god bless!",2022-08-16,1,Lyft,

they pretend the prices usually drop after rush hour and the airport crowd thins out, but they don't. i experienced it first hand.

i'm not too upset about the account closing, uber is more readily available with significant less wait times and more drivers, plus i use uber eats and both let you earn rewards. the problem i'm having, is that through cogo, i paid for a year membership which i'm now lo longer able to access. i've reached out to lyft's so called customer service, and have only been told my case has been escalated to a special team to further assist me and they'd email me. this has gone on for several weeks, with lyft only giving the same generic automated response then closing the chat so i'm unable to continue trying to get help. no one has contacted me by email phone or chat and at this point i feel that i've been bamboozled for getting that membership. lyft and cogo aren't a single company, cogo is simply using lyft to handle their rentals through their app and that's their decision to do so. but when i pay for a service that i'm no longer able to use, and i repeatedly reach out to understand why and get nothing back in return, that's just stealing basically. i've asked for to be issued a refund and still the only thing i get is no response or the same ""escalated to special team"" response which i think we all know is companies way of saying just throw that one out, i'm not dealing with this customer.
lyft has shown me several times that they don't care about customers, customers being in the right and customers hard earned money, time and probably most importantly, their privacy and security. i have seen (and i have this documented, i wouldn't be mentioning this if i didn't) where lyft was unsure about my payment method belonging to me so they had me verify by typing in the card information. that debit card is actually mine but i'd lost it and didn't remember the number so i got them wrong. during a verification, which means you're verifying because you're not sure, if someone doesn't respond with the required answers, they can't be verified. but lyft decided that instead of just telling me that information wasn't correct, that they'd also flat out no joke, show me the name, card number, expiration date, cvv, and mailing address. i was beyond horrified when i saw this and immediately took a screenshot so i could have proof to follow up about that. so basically, if you try and and someone's card, lyft will give you all the information they have on that person's card which is some kind of scary i wasn't ready for. i do suspect that my complaint about that had something to do with my account being closed. to be honest, i wasn't the most civil when i spoke to them, and rightfully so. they kept insisting that isn't something they'd do and i'm just like, who do you think you're lying, i'm sorry talking to when i have evidence?
lyft will get no business from me ever again and i've also tried having my card information for other cards removed but it tells me i need to have one on the app. the app i can't use btw. so i've taken the obvious precautions and had those cards cancelled and replaced as well as taking my bank account information off their platform.
lyft is untrustworthy and frivolous with their customers information, information we assume and expect is securely being kept. this whole experience has gotten me to worry about past information i've shared with them, question random charges to cards during the time i've had with them and assume logically that lyft's lack of due diligence was at fault then. if you use lyft, do so carefully, you don't know what information they're disclosing, to whoever that may be and how it could affect you, devastatingly possibly.",2022-06-06,1,Lyft,

recently, we were in san francisco and mostly used uber because of our previous experience with lyft in new orleans. we decided to use lyft for a ride from our hotel to sfo. i toggled between lyft and uber and decided to go with lyft, based on the fee indicated at around $35. the driver was fine and the ride went quickly, with no traffic jams incurred. i didn't have a chance to check the charge until we arrived home from our flight. i found out we were charged $41. it may not seem like a huge difference, but a fare is a fare and without any reason, that's what we should have been charged. when using uber during this trip, the charges were the same as indicated when we chose the ride. i tried several times to dispute the charge, but was only able to do so via the system set up by lyft. each time, i was informed by the app that the fare was reasonable. i cannot find any other way to contact lyft via email or phone, which is why i am writing this review.

then it would immediately place the order and i would have to try to cancel. but, by the time i thought i had it canceled, there was already a car on the way. i was never able to successfully cancel.
before all of this bs was said and done i had to call three different drivers to alert them not to come. and then one driver came anyway.
i am thoroughly pissed off, put out, disappointed, and any other information that can be thought of to describe my frustration with lyft!
i understand i will be charged for each driver that responded to compensate them for their time, which i can understand if it were my fault for getting them en-route to my pick-up location, but this ordeal was not my fault.
i expect any charges to my account to be removed, immediately!
i will no longer try to use the ""services"" of lyft!

( fyi i keep a notebook and pen next to me to keep evidence of every wrong, illegal or suspicious thing that takes place by lyft) . also just to let everyone know this is my side job and i only work friday and saturday 6pm-6am usually and maybe the occasional sunday or a weekday night if bored or need cash.
1) customer gets in and asks to stop at store real quick . for this example his ride is say 11 miles and he requests to go to a gas station 3 miles out of the way … i hear a yell from back seat and he says “lyft is trying to charge me $105 to stop at store 3 miles away” ….. sadly this is 99.9% of stories as lyft literally tries to get $50-$100 everytime for a couple mile stop. then it says it only takes 20% and gives the rest to us. i have multiple proof evidences that out of $120 fare the rider would be paying i maybe would get $40….
2) they “care about there driver and our health” yet the two puking instances i have had in my car and during covid no less . they don’t give a crap . i was puked on my neck literally from a women behind my seat , which could have contaminated my entire car and myself with covid positive bio waste . it went everywhere, it was my first ride on a saturday with a rare $13 power zone ! then after the puke while waiting for customer service to answer i was turning down several rides which easy would have been $10-$25 a ride. what does lyft tell me? “there professional opinion from the pics that there giving me $80 for the puke … i went off on them about covid and my health and loss of wages and they said sorry they don’t pay any of that just enough to clean the car which wasn’t even enough for real detail … so i loss over $300 that saturday and got puked on and potentially contracted covid .
3) my favorite. example : i drove from 6pm-1am and it’s busy and straight driving no breaks. right before the 2am bar last call i decide to take a 20 min break and stretch and contact customer support during this time to resolve a issue from earlier in night. well i contact support and explain in detail the issue with typing long paragraphs to get point across. someone answers and says i’m glad to help give me a minute to review case…. i wait 10 min and text back and it says “we’re helping someone else we’ll get to you next” like really ?then someone answers and says “hello my name is xxxx how can i help ? im furious as i have to retype multiple paragraphs and explain all over again cause the last person passed the puck and didn’t wanna work on my issue..so i express anger but end up typing and explaining all over again… she apologizes deeply and says give me a min let me review your case…. no joke 10 min goes by and i text back and it says “were helping someone else and well get to you next” literally the 3rd person does the same f****** thing and i when i got to the 4th person i was so irate i could def have gone to prison for homicide of a lyft employee … my issue never got resolved and my “break” lasted a hour and a half trying to get my issue resolved which it didn’t and i lost wages dipping into a good time of night to be driving… this has happened 3 times to me with customer support ..
4) the bonuses are a joke - at first they were amazing and i didn’t understand why everyone was on “strike” but waited 2 weeks and immediately got the picture. they replaced the multiple ride streak bonus with “guarantees” which would be good if they made sense. however, getting a “give 20 rides for a $75 bonus guarantee. which of you do the math that’s like $3.50 a ride . there isn’t a .00001% chance you take 20 rides in a single night and everyone is under $3.50 . it’s almost statistically impossible. but if you dont hit that $ amount then lyft will kick in the rest guaranteed. these are all the time now,

1. they put streak bonuses in place for drivers to incentivize them to stay out during busy times. however when you have one ride left they will log you off saying you need to take a break, subsequently breaking the streak and screwing the driver out of their bonus.

2. if a passenger cancels a ride after two minutes the driver is paid a cancel fee based on distance traveled. however, if your eta changes based on traffic, not using toll roads (driver pays out of pocket) and the passenger cancels. driver gets no cancel fee.

3. having a driver, drive 17 miles to pickup a call for a passenger that’s trip is 1 1/2 miles. that trip pays the driver a whopping $2.32 while lyft charges the passenger over $7.00.

those are just a few. adding insult to injury, when you bring these issues up, all you’re told too bad

because of not being able to afford the medical bills, i avoided a trip to the hospital by spending the next 48hrs with my foot elevated, wrapped, and iced. thankfully enough, the swelling went down but the area is still bruised with a possible metatarsal fracture. i am glad i didn’t go because it has been made apparent that there is a good chance i wouldn’t have been reimbursed at all. with no medical document provided as promised, and the canned email stating policy and terms in lieu of basic customer service, it seems as though the only way this situation would be made right is through a lawsuit.

after reading multiple reviews, it seems like the issue of rider safety is a common occurrence – all with similar results of lyft still paying the driver in question and providing the injured rider with little to no compensation or peace of mind.

i don’t know about you, but i definitely can not condone supporting a company that continues to capitalize while putting their loyal customer’s safety at risk.",2020-10-13,1,Lyft,

LYFT SCAMS YOU WITH FAKE PROMO CODES!,"driver was fine, ride was fine. had a $20 promo code for a free ride from nov 27th to nov 30th. i decided to use the promo code on the 29th, after a friend suggested i give them another chance. previously, i couldn't use their app at all because their system refused my card i had on file if i tried to use it more than for one-way trips, and i confirmed with my bank that it was not the bank doing this, it was them and the system at lyft!

so i stopped using lyft for about 2 years. recently a friend tells me that ""it's changed"" and i should ""give it a try"" with the free promo code. ok. i installed the app, did 2 rides, and then he gave me the promo code. i entered it on the app, and it said ""ok, you have 1 free ride remaining"".

the driver came on time but couldn't figure out where she was going. i was right in front of her and she just sat there at someone else's house. i was like ? eventually i walked up to her and said ""hello, are you looking for me?"" she said that the app took her to 2 houses up and said that's where i was when i was never near there.

ok, i do a round trip for $7. i know this route well, because i did it twice already with lyft and about a dozen times with uber. the fare is always $7. it's $9 if i leave a $2 tip on top of it, which i usually do.

after the trip, i go home and about an hour later, decide to look at my bank account. guess what? $15 dollar charge from lyft. i am like wth?! i write to lyft support, saying ""i had a free promo code for up to $20, i used it for a $7 fare. i was charged $15 after leaving a $2 tip. what the hell is going on here?""

support writes back, and says: ""the ride was pleasant and efficient. you were charged correctly. check to make sure that no one else uses your phone by locking it so they cannot use the app"".

i wrote back and said ""what manner of stupidity is this? the ride's efficiency or the driver is not the problem, the problem i had is that i was charged $15 for a $7 ride that was supposed to be free! do you understand any english at all or anything i just said to you?!""

i messaged a friend, and they suggested i try to find a number to call them for support. i did, and it was straight-up a call center out of india or some other country.

they put me on hold for 22 minutes...and then hung up. by now, i'm fuming. i call back and get another rep in bangladesh or wherever they are sending people to keep customer service payouts as low and pathetic as possible.

this rep asks me what i'm calling about. i say ""if i'm not hung up on like i was after 22 minutes on hold with my last call here, i want to know why i was charged $15 for a $7 ride when i had a $20 promo code to make it a free ride? can you help me with that please?""

""yes, i will have to put you on hold for a few minutes"", she says

""well i hope it isn't 20 minutes and i get hung up on again"", i respond.

she assures me that the fare was adjusted, and that the system automatically charged me for another person's fare on a near-by route exactly $15 and she doesn't know why !!!

i checked my bank account a half an hour later, and guess what? it was adjusted alright. there is now a second pending charge for $20 instead of $15! f--k lyft!

guess what? this is the last time i will ever use lyft for anything! i don't care if i have a $50 or a $100 credit because it will cost me $200 for them to say i even have one! and if these charges don't drop off the face of the earth in a few days from my bank statement like pocahantis in dubai promised me this morning, i am going to go to the bank and dispute every last one of these bogus charges and file a report with the federal trade commission the moment i'm done with that.

i have had both good and bad experiences with uber and regular cab services over the years, but nothing as bad as this with deliberate attempts to scam me and overcharge me as they did.

first off, as soon as i got in the car the driver mentioned i was going to the airport and asked where i was flying. he kept calling me pretty girl and making me feel super uncomfortable. so inappropriate. i said california. he said he couldn't believe i was going to ca where all the ""f*g**t's live"" and that is where there are a bunch of n-words. he also said all those f'ing liberals over there would kidnap me and turn me into one of those f'ing vegans. i found it extremely inappropriate to make racial slurs, lgbt slurs, and make political comments while i was stuck in his vehicle at 5:30 a.m.

his car smelled horrifically like smoke. i have asthma and am extremely allergic to smoke. i started coughing and he said ""oh is it the smoke? yeah i smoked this morning"" and then proceeded to say ""it's my car i do what i damn want"".

by the time i got to the airport i was full asthma attack. i actually had to get medical attention.

lyft told me the following:

(1) they can't stop their drivers from smoking, even though their website states they understand smoking can cause pulmonary issues (they have prior knowledge of this and admit it on their website);
(2) lyft refused to remove this racist, homophobic, derogatory individual and have stated they will allow him to continue driving;
(3) lyft refused to refund my ride;
(4) lyft is now refusing to even talk to me.

look up the class action complaint from women who have been sexually assaulted by lyft drivers and how lyft did nothing. i looked it up yesterday and am horrified. i will never use this company again and i implore you to do the same. also, if you have similar issues with lyft please message me i will be contacting the ca attorneys handling the other lyft lawsuits for a potential additional action based upon their negligence. they state that there are arbitration agreements but they are unconscionable and unenforceable in instances of extreme negligence which is what i think we have here.",2019-10-25,1,Lyft,

if you use lyft often, expect to find yourself in cars driving well above speed limits and taking many unnecessary risks. drivers are squeezed to the bone by lyft and some of them will compromise anyone's safety to make ends meet.
if you enjoy the thrill of these life-threatening situations, knowing that they are part of lyft's business model of expansion and expense cutting at all costs, please enjoy.
i have to admit i have turned a blind eye too many times because shared riding can be convenient.
the last drop for me was being stuck in a car driving on a busy freeway for 40 minutes without functioning seat belts. when i complained to the driver, he ignored me. when i complained to lyft, they pretended to take this seriously at first, then a week later they dismissed the issue and said that all lyft rides are non-refundable, regardless of what happens.
apparently, this is a normal part of their service.

i needed a ride to the store on the corner. it is less than a mile and normally i would walk. but it was raining and i needed some medicine.

when the driver picked me up, his stereo was up very loud. i take a seat and immediately saw that his windshield was shattered. this wasn't a crack...it was a spiderweb shatter in the center spanning out over the entire windshield. this worried me that not only was his view obstructed but also that it was dangerous.

on top of that, he was texting while driving checking for his next fare i assume (glancing up and down through the cracked windshield while driving in the rain).

this short 2 block dangerous ride was still $7.

i contacted lyft who responded they ""take reports like this very seriously but do not offer refunds"".

they might be very slightly cheaper than uber but at least uber would have communicated better and offered a refund or credit for the next ride.

i used lyft 3 times this week and this was my only complaint due to safety and they emailed a generic copy/paste response and told me that i should have requested another ride. however i was standing in the rain, was unaware of the windshield/loud music until i sat down, and did not know he would be staring at his phone while driving.

some would say that i should have brought my concerns to the driver's attention. i tried...but the driver did not speak english. he just nodded, smiled, and laughed.",2019-04-07,1,Lyft,

i had a driver pick me up, as usual, i took the back seat. i was preoccupied with something on my phone and did not realize the driver had an ""unauthorized third party"" - a female companion - who was riding along in the car until we were a couple blocks into the ride and after the driver had deviated from the route, driving through several unfamiliar side neighborhoods as a ""short cut"".

i reported this incident to lyft and requested a refund (or credit) for *this* ride. the refund was requested because the driver violated lyfts contract with me - their customer.

per lyft's grossly substandard (hot garbage) customer service department - i ""should have"" canceled the ride in the middle of a trip and exited the vehicle *in a strange neighborhood* and then called a new lyft to take me where i wanted to go --


seems legit - it totally makes sense that i should not only put myself at additional risk by escalating a situation with a driver who clearly has no regard for the rules and protocols of his job - but also i should pay 2 base fees for their ill-trained driver breaking their contract.

lyft's outsourced ""quezon city"" customer service team has not only lost this company my business as a longtime rider but also ensured that the app was uninstalled by the 3 other riders in my household who also previously used their service.

vicki in the red dodge caliber (538xib) was the woman that picked me up.
the lyft app took her to a wrong destination that i didn't recognize.
she verified that the address she was at was not the one i gave her but nevertheless, she rudely kicked me out of the car and left me stranded.
i explained to her that i was just visiting the us and i completely did not know where to start in the wired place.. she told me she doesn't care, i had to get out coz she had another client waiting and it ain't her fault that the app map was wrong.
i was so terrified, i tell u, i felt like the woman was going to beat me up if i didn't get out.
i wonder if lyft does not screen its drivers, coz this is the highlight level of uninvited cruelty i have ever seen.
even when i begged her to at least drop me off in the nearest shopping center on her way, she told me she ain't my 'slave' that i paid lyt for the ride no her.
i believe she used that term because am an african lady and she is white, but i didn't even get into that.. her tone was so cruel like one more second in her car and she wd beat the hell out of me.
so i was abused, dumped, and lost. with a dead phone i had to walk 1and half hours to get home while asking strangers for directions on their google maps. (u know how hard that can be)
very terrifying experience, my eyes still bring tears as i write this. it was so so painful.

if a passenger requests a driver, and that driver is 20 minutes away or more (or high mileage), the passenger should receive a notification stating ""driver is out of your range, this ride may cost an extra $2-$5 for this driver to come out. find a new driver or proceed?"". this would benefit us drivers, who get sent 25 minutes away from our area, to drive someone 2 miles.

also, there should be a 'favorite driver' implementation within passengers apps. it should allow 3-6 of a passengers preferred drivers. it could have a glowing pink ring around their profile picture when the driver(s) is active. since us drivers are performing a service, the passengers should be allowed to choose the service they prefer - when able.

this wouldn't prevent new drivers from receiving rides, or seasoned drivers. because you'd still be receiving new passengers, due to favorites not always needing a ride.

hope you consider this. if you want a better perspective of my idea, google ""t-mobile sidekick slide"". that phone had a similar idea; top contacted people were placed first so you could instantly navigate to them without searching. had their photo as well. it would be fantastic for everyone.",2018-02-15,3,Lyft,

(uber, whom i recently signed up with last month, does not employ either of the aforementioned restrictions on their drivers. i have since been much happier on their platform and prefer to drive for them. their platform is simply easier and more straightforward. let me know when you guys adjust to be more like them. tip: offer simple guarantees as normal weekly goals. ie. 50 rides = $400 or earn $15 bonus for every 10 rides completed [things like that])

-approximately 19% of my passengers have tipped me (i've given about 500 rides since i started). i'm courteous and always ask if the temperature inside the car is comfortable, i'm friendly, and i keep my vehicle clean, but i've found that despite providing good service, it doesn't really make much of a difference as far as tipping goes.

-lyft takes 25% of your total earnings. i understand it's a business and they want to make money, but if they want to keep drivers long term and control the larger markets (such as la and ny) over uber, they should consider taking a flat rate for each ride instead of 1/4 of every fare.

-after lyft takes their share of the pie, i spend nearly 1/3 of my remaining income on gas for my car. this doesn't include regular maintenance, such as an oil change. lyft's advertisements that you can make $1,000+ a week are not accurate, as you would have to spend over 8 hours per day driving, and as fatigue sets in and a driver gets tired from being on the road longer than that, it can become a safety hazard.

-lyft does not reimburse you for the time and distance that it takes to get to a passenger. your passenger can be 20-30 mins. from where you are and you don't earn anything if the passenger cancels on you when you are en route to pick them up. also, when you arrive, the passenger has 5 minutes to come out and get in your car. the app states that ""your fare includes wait time."" i have found that this is not the case.

-it's a plus that you are able to make your own hours. the flexibility is good and you do not have to conform to a regular schedule if you do not want to. the scheduled pickup feature is also a benefit, both to drivers and passengers. it is one of the few positives allotted to the drivers, as it gives you somewhat of an idea of how far you have to take a passenger (if you get a request from a passenger and it's not a scheduled pick up, you have no idea how far you have to travel/where you are going until after the passenger gets into your car. the ""waybill"" has never shown me the destination prior to picking the rider up).

there are a few other points i could make, but those are the major ones.

if you're looking for extra income, lyft is a good way to earn a few extra bucks. if you're looking for a way to make a livable wage, it's probably not going to work out.",2018-01-29,3,Lyft,

far away pick up requests. due to the app excessively sending me far pick up requests everyday when mostly when i first log on for the day. this issue happens all over the bay area. this issue has kept my acceptance rating below average on a constant basis and it's not fair to receive these crazy profit less requests.

driver, customer related issues, extra stops as in drive thru detours should be charged a significant fee for making the driver make a oit stop. we don't make money sitting in drive through and we don't like people eating in our cars. no eating policy needs to be implemented. i'm sick of people trying to eat messy type foods in my car. also almost everyone needs to take a class on how to close car doors. almost everyone slams my door. my windows are starting to get shorted and i dont have money to be fixing things that should not be broken.

there needs to be better incentives. i don't get power driver ride bonuses. i would like the option to do a certain amount of rides in a week for a cash bonus. the hourly percentage bonus only is in the city of san francisco. there needs to be more boost incentives in the lower east bay, south bay and tri valley areas. cities like fremont, union city and hayward never have boost prime time zones.


last but not least the least fares should be at least a dollar a mile minimum after lyft percentage cuts.

i do have a couple suggestions:
• a panic button either rider or driver can access that will alert police to find the vehicle to assist if necessary

the ""trust and service fee"" is advertised as $1.90, but occasionally passengers will ask me to ""end"" the ride while they're still in the car so they can finish the transaction before getting out, and i notice that the difference between my ""fare"" and theirs is higher, like $2.30. so that's extra money that lyft is skimming off the top, which is quite alot when you multiply it by every ride!

if a passenger leaves a bad review, say 1 or 2 stars, they should be forced to include a comment. this helps us drivers learn what is it that we are doing wrong so that we can improve.

if we signal our arrival and have to move 100 feet, say, or if it's a poor reception area like a parking garage (this applies to many las vegas strip pickups), the app will assume that we have picked up the passenger, even if we haven't. then if a passenger doesn't show, it doesn't give us the $5 fee because it thinks we're already on the move. this is frustrating and the app should not ""assume"" that we've picked up a passenger unless we explicitly confirm it on the app.",2017-07-18,4,Lyft,

2)please consider bringing back smaller power bonus for drivers that are not able to do complete the full weekly requirements currently set.
3) allow drivers to screen passengers without % penalty in accepting rides/passengers with low ratings. few times i've accepted rides from passengers with 4.5 rating and ending up giving them only 1 star after ending rides.
4) most important; advise passengers when requesting rides, look at your surroundings to allow easier pick up from lyft drivers. at times i've canceled rides where the location is difficult or can create traffic hazards. better to miss or cancel rides than to receive traffic tickets worth hundreds. sfmta is watching us very closely. thanks

my positive experiences with lyft unfortunately end there. due to some error, oversight, or intentional attempt to defraud me- lyft has been overcharging their commission by 5% on every single ride i've given to passengers for months.

it's been weeks since discovering the problem and opening a ticket with their support department, and since then i've been outright lied to, ignored, and gotten zero feedback from lyft as to how this might have happened. lyft has not officially acknowledged what happened, apologized, or provided me with a reasonable timeline for fixing my account and paying me back what they owe me for well over 1000 rides and counting. the only way i've been able to gain traction and get someone to take a serious look at my account was blowing up @asklyft on twitter.

i appreciate the gesture.

however, you are completely wrong about not being able to schedule rides in advance. i refer you to this link on your web site and the accompanying text that says you can schedule up to 7 days in advance. in fact, this is what i did the first time i used lyft, and it worked. but the second time, no driver showed up.

you should try it and see how it works. just click on the clock icon next to the box where you set your pickup location, and you will be offered a range of pickup days and times.

i am shocked that lyft’s own customer service representatives don’t know lyft policies or services. yet more reason not to use your service.

[link deleted, but you can google to find the site: lyft schedule rides in advance]

with scheduled rides, you can schedule lyft rides up to seven days in advance and relax knowing your ride will be there when you need it. a ride will arrive within the 10-minute pick-up window you selected in the app.

scheduled rides are currently available in the following cities, with more coming soon:

a.. atlanta
b.. boise
c.. boston
d.. charleston
e.. chicago
f.. columbus
g.. dallas
h.. denver
i.. las vegas

hi davis,

you've been really patient about this matter so thank you so much. this is certainly not the experience we want for new members of our community so allow me to help.

let me make things right, as this is definitely not the kind of experience we want you to have with us. to make it up for you, i granted you a $10 off on your next ride. this will be part of your payment on your next ride, no need to enter any promo code. i know this is not much but at least to compensate for the inconvenience that had caused you.

due to the nature of lyft as an on-demand platform, there is currently no way to schedule or prearrange a lyft in advance. all rides need to be requested in real time through the mobile app. once a driver has accepted the request, we’ll show you an estimated time of arrival, and your driver’s name and car. you can refer to the map in the app to watch as the car icon approaches you.

we are always working with drivers to continually improve the service that lyft provides, so hearing this kind of feedback is extremely helpful.

i hope i was able to help you. feel free to message us if you have any other concerns.

have an awesome day in seattle, davis!

all the best,

i have received no response to this complaint or another one i reported the same day. i’m about to give on lyft permanently, as it’s clear that you don’t have systems in place that allow you to provide minimal customer service—either reliable rides or prompt response to problems.



apr 14, 9:22 am pdt

i scheduled a ride in advance for 8:50-9:00 a.m. today for my mother. i received a reminder yesterday. we waited until 9:01 and no driver showed up today, and there was no indication that a driver had been requested.

i am a new customer to lyft and this is unacceptable. i will go back to using uber if lyft can't provide reliable service for my mother's medical appointments.

passengers in lyft lines should have a limited rating system for the driver and to be able to rate the other passengers in the lyft line.
ratings should have a time limit.
charge the passenger if they cancel after driving for 10 mins to pick up. or if they cancel when you arrive. must be actively driving to passenger and ask why passenger cancelled.
just some suggestions.
other than that. lyft is great!
oh yes! two more things. fares are too low in san francisco and/or lyft fees should be dropped back to 20% for all drivers.
have a wonderful day and keep lyfting!",2017-03-15,4,Lyft,

my other disappointment was the change to the power driver bonus. i was able to make the bonus after many hours and rides for 3 weeks. during that time lyft was running ads on the radio stating how drivers could keep up to 95% of their ride fees, which i was able to do. then they changed it and that option was no longer available and to make the equivalent required double the peak rides and an additional 25 rides on top of it. i wrote to lyft to express my disappointment about this and was informed that their bonus structure is dynamic and changes. my question is why lead people on thinking that they can make up to 95% and then change it. i felt baited then switched.

the driver tried to go a long route which i corrected (he thought i wasn't paying attention as i was on the phone). when he dropped me, he didn't end the ride, he jumped on the interstate and headed up i-77 to iredell county. by the time i got lyft on the phone (support 855-865-9553) he was 25+ miles away. the rep saw the ride was still in progress and had to manually disconnect me from the ride. he told me he would make sure i wasn't overcharged. i told him in lieu of this, the ride should be comped which he said would probably happen. did he follow through??? no, just got the $50 bill for the fraudulent ride. btw, i did attempt to contact the driver by phone prior to calling lyft, it went to vm 4 times. i even left him a vm with my personal number in case this was just some app glitch or something, he never returned my call, solidifying to me this was him scamming and long ride.

i called them back tonight and they said the only thing they could do was to forward this on to some other support team and someone would get back to me this upcoming week.

meantime, im out $50 until they feel like getting around to resolve this. i told them they needed to refund the fare back tonight, he declined.

- i would like lyft giving us the flexibility about how far we want to drive ( like give us a radius), so we don't have to worry about being far from our family.
- i would like lyft letting us to see the passenger's destination
- i would like lyft to change the lyft line system by
• letting us see the all pickup addresses of our passengers, so we can pickup the rides from the closest one from us and not making us have to drive around and around.
• making us pickup the closest riders
• giving us more requests after we dropped our passengers.
- i would like lyft change the ""destination filter"" system by giving us any kind of lyft passengers, not giving us lyft line only when we use that feature.

unfortunately, lyft has turned out to be only a temporary fix. while the flexibility is great, i end up only making slightly more than minimum wage, after gas. it's a shame, too, because i actually like driving more than i thought i would.

lyft line has been a particular problem. frequently, a second ride will cancel, and i won't get a cancellation fee, and the first rider has been put out, and is less likely to tip.

speaking of tips: i have a 4.93 driver rating after over 500 rides (and great reviews!), and there are plenty of days where i don't receive any tips. that's not lyft's fault, of course, but their claim that 60% of all rides end in a tip is certainly stretching the truth, if not downright dishonest.

i also think there should be some sort of charge for pax that cancel the ride after i've already arrived. that's happened a few times, and it just seems wrong.

finally, the charge for time is far too low! many times pax ask me to stop and wait while they shop, or pick up prescriptions, or buy pot. i've waited as long as 40 minutes for one. that 16 cents per minute, whether in traffic or a target parking lot is far too low. pax take advantage of this, and it's an easy fix for lyft.

that said, i'm grateful to have lyft. of course everyone thinks they should be paid more, but in the case of cancellations after arrival, lyft line's lower rates, and the ""time charge,"" i think passengers would be willing to pay more for the value and service we are offering.

overall, i like the driving. the money is adequate. if i could even average 25-30% more hourly, i would consider doing it long term.",2016-11-15,4,Lyft,

2.if we rate pax 5 stars, that means we want the customer get the discounts, and come back again using the service, so the more 5 stars the pax gets, the better for everyone.

3. lyft has price limit, it will not be more than 200$ in most cities. competitor's no limit price goes all the way up, some are paying $800 - $1500 per ride.

4.privacy, at the end of the ride, the customer's address will be removed from the driver's app, but not on competitor's driver's app.

5.to be lyft driver, there is background check, not only criminal record, it sometimes even goes to check misdemeanor record. some pax told me her boyfriend rejected from driving for lyft, but accepted by uber. lyft rejected him because of some record in the past that doesn't have anything to do with his driving and people skill. what he did was painting someone's wall while he was in highschool long time ago and it was described as vandalism, is it too harsh? i don't know, reader decide.

6. in the process to be lyft driver, lyft has mentor that want to see how the newbie drives the car. mentor sit down together with new driver and see how things going on before he can start driving for real pax. but not on uber platform.

7. lyft and starbucks, use lyft between 5 am to 10 am for star rewards, redeem it for free coffee at starbucks.

while the pay is relatively fair, a new change in bonus structure is an obvious greed play. rather than raise rates for riders, which most say they think is shockingly low, they are making the bonus structure so difficult that the likelihood of hitting bonus will tip the cost/bebefit scale against driving more. i hear often from uber drivers they are frustrated by how much they have to work to earn equivalebt to lyft. by increasing ride numbers to 70 for bonus, it when it already takes 40-55 hours to get the current 55, it isn'5 worth driving because it will take more gas and less per hour to acheive the extra 15. most drivers i have talked to will drive less.

lyft needs to find a balance where if the time and distance to get to a request is greater than the ride distance and time, some process of compensating for the negative value should be determined. driving 16 minutes out ones way for a 2 minute, minimum charge ride is excessive.

for the phoenix airport, adjustments need to be made. sitting for 90 minutes for a $4.00 ride is excessive. it is a gamble, but the same as the previous paragraph shpuld be determined, or lyft could restrict the airport to newer vehicles that receive bonus and/or for those that maintain a 4.9 favorability. there are way too many vehicles for too few riders. i have had comments from riders that are surprised that i am dressed nicely and are surprised to get a clean, newer car.

overall, i love lyft. but, if the company decides to punish drivers earnings to increase their own any further, it will reduce the number and quality of drivers. i will be driving less, and more tactically because if the new changes because the bonus change has made the extra effort not worth the wear, tear, and extra hours and expense.",2016-10-15,4,Lyft,

the only means of contact is by email which they take usually one to two days to respond. if you've got an urgent or pressing matter, that again is unacceptable. after literally writing them 5 to 8 emails a day and sending hard letters to their corporate office, and also threatening to share my experience on yelp, tripadvisor, facebook, twitter, and then threatening to take them to court, they finally forked over what they owed, with some crazy crap about making a one-time exception.

then, after finally getting paid i decided to continue to drive for lyft. a few days after continuing my service one day my app just stopped working and wouldn't allow me to sign on. to date have sent 9 communications asking to be updated on the situation and explain why my driver service was turned off. i have not received one single response. i even got an email asking me to rate the the service of the response which i never received.

the good:

1. scheduling: a flexible schedule is the main reason people start doing ride-share because it affords them time to do things they want, and work the hours they can without feeling tied down to a set schedule or overtime/budget restrictions.

2. social aspect: meeting new people is a great way to socialize and network, while providing a valuable service to the community. driving people who may not be capable of driving themselves, for one reason or another, gives you a greater feeling of personal satisfaction than many other jobs in this pay range.

3. tipping/pay for waiting: lyft is consistently setting the bar higher when it comes to making sure drivers are as well taken care of as riders. unlike uber, it allows in-app tipping, and it pays drivers to wait for passengers if they take longer than a minute to get in the car.

4. pictures of riders: another plus for driving with lyft as opposed to uber is that you have the option (if the rider chooses) of having a picture of who you are picking up. this is extremely helpful in crowded area where you may have multiple people who are waiting for their drivers.

5. three stars or less: lyft will automatically ensure you do not get connected with a rider whom you previously rated 3 stars or less. my most recent experience with this feature was even followed up by a representative from lyft asking for more details about my less than satisfactory trip. with uber, you'd have to send an e-mail asking them to not match you with said rider, which is way more inconvenient.

the bad:

1. you're considered an independent contractor but you can't set your own prices, which is really a catch 22. you're also at the mercy of lyft approving as many drivers to the platform as they wish, which can make getting rides much more difficult. there is no fixed rider/driver ratio so there could be 20 ride requests and 50-75 drivers working at any given time, which makes your chances of getting a consistent amount of rides very small. if you are doing this as your main source of income, this can be very frustrating.

2. long distance trip requests/no trip information prior to accepting ride: in order to differentiate themselves from a traditional taxi, lyft doesn't give you any idea where the rider requesting a ride wants to go. at times, you may receive a request from a rider who is 20-30 minutes away that may just want to go across the street to the gas station. after you deduct your expenses from what that trip made you, you just lost money. furthermore, if you don't accept every trip request, your acceptance rate goes down which will put you out of contention for the power driver bonus.

3. less prime time bonuses: as with uber, as the number of drivers increase, the less demand there is and the less reason there is to pay more for a ride. this makes it increasingly difficult to make decent money.

4. possible payment denial, even if rider actually damages car: i've only had two instances with lyft regarding a damage claim. one where a passenger threw up, and another where a passenger scratched my leather by dragging their luggage across the seat. in both instances, lyft refused to make the rider pay for the damages because even though all the information and pictures were provided, there wasn't enough damage done to warrant any payment.

5. no benefits: neither lyft nor uber pay for anything related to your car. you are responsible for gas, maintenance, repairs and the rapid depreciation that comes with driving thousands of miles a month. after you take your expenses out of what's left after lyft takes their commission, unless you're driving a vehicle that doesn't break, uses little to no gas, and holds it's value extremely well. it's very hard to justify using lyft to make money at their current rates.",2016-07-22,3,Lyft,

50$ a day? how possibly did you get the 1500$ a week?
the reward points are meaningless. like the 7 cents per gallon at shell when the price is half a dollar higher than everywhere.
i am destroying my once respectable van, and there is nothing like extra money. lift is a need for unemployed people, of which some others are making lots of money. now i understand the happy face of the ceo. but you should see mine after twelve hours driving, back pain and paid a quarter of my earnings (50$ of 200$) to you. i am a mba student here about to finish it. whitout lift i may be died before, but this is the honest feedback.
good things :
the app is good but consumes too much data compared with others.
the support team is good.

lyft seems to be engaged on a price war with uber in los angeles. unfortunately, making a living wage has become extremely difficult as a result. i believe pricing is actually hurting lyft's ability to retain drivers. i also believe there is a misconception about the importance of pricing to our ridership.

lyft and uber riders in los angeles are completely different demographics. the lyft rider prefers the lyft experience due largely to the perception that lyft is community minded and that it treats its drivers well. every rider i have spoken to has told me they don't mind paying more for the quality of the lyft experience. this fare war is costing lyft experienced drivers and is hurting growth.

driver retention, or the lack thereof, is expensive. offering sign-up bonuses as a means of growing the business is good, however driver participation would increase substantially if the prospect of making a good living wasn't so difficult. think about this. why would a driver increase his competition for riders by adding more lyft drivers? the incentive may be a short term benefit, but more drivers means longer wait times between calls. these wait times are too long as it is. however, if the rate of pay were higher, driver retention would be less of an issue and sign-up bonus money could be saved.

lastly, uber airport pickups and drop-offs at lax are a guaranteed 'surge' price, meaning all uber drivers are guaranteed surge rates. airport dropoffs and pickups should have a guaranteed minimum for the dirver. frankly, a guaranteed payout of $25.00 is still substantially lower than allother alternatives.

why are we giving this ride away? i don;t know if you realize what it is like to pickup riders in west l.a., drive them through morning rush hour traffic, negotiate the crush of traffic at lax, only to find a charge of $17.00 for more than an hour of your time. this makes zero sense.

lyft drivers are in this business to make money. extra money. we often put upwards of $170- $200 per week in the gas tank. we absorb the wear and tear on our vehicles. we have to endure the quirks and anti-social personalities of those who use the service. it would be nice to be able to depend on a rate of pay that justifies our investment.

end this absurd price war. recognize the difference is the rider profile between the uber and lyft ridership. guarantee a logical lax drop-off/ pickup minimum. guarantee more money for drivers instead of large signup bonuses.

thank you for your kind attention",2016-07-16,5,Lyft,

the good:
the power driver bonus incentive.
decent customer service response (need to work on the turn around though).
most people are cool.
the driver app has improved.
integrated tip option.
cash for referrals.

the bad:
too many drivers (can't meet bonus).
low fares: cheap rides = cheap people.
lyft line is not worth it. seriously.
lack of marketing for more passengers, not drivers.
lack of primetime thanks to too many drivers in the city.
lack of feedback for less than 5 stars. if we can't continue to the next screen without rating, then they should provide feedback for less than 5 stars so we can improve.
took away passenger destination. i've never cherry-picked... i just like to know where i'm going.
low rated passengers should get the boot just like we can.

conclusion:
this company relies on its drivers for profit. value your drivers and they will value you. make it worth it for us and we will continue to drive.",2016-07-15,3,Lyft,

unfortunately, lyft has given me a bad experience with their customer service.

during our nyc trip, i activated my lyft account on june 10th. they had a great introduction discount of 20% on all rides for new accounts in nyc during a 7 day period. i used lyft for 3 rides on the morning of june 12th, then my account became locked at 1:52pm.

as any new customer would, i sent a message through lyft's website and waited. i waited because we were about to call for another ride to visit coney island and the nyc aquarium from midtown. after no response from lyft, i switched the other company and used them for the remainder of our time in nyc because my lyft account remained locked. i even checked with my credit card and they told me no lock or anything was showing on my end.

it took lyft three days to respond to my account lock request. and all they told me was my account's unlocked. and by this time we were already back home.

lyft representatives would not acknowledge or provide me with why my account was placed on hold. nor would they acknowledge that their discount introduction period pretty much was thrown away, doing a disservice to their drivers.

as with most businesses, it's our choice where to spend our money. unfortunately, i will never use lyft after their poor customer service.

this experience does a disservice to their drivers. in the three drives we experienced, they were fun, safe and informative for us tourists. it saddens me to see businesses treat customers this way and i hope a change for the better comes from this information.",2016-06-27,2,Lyft,

lyft does put a pending $25 charge on your card, but they only charge the ride amount - i've checked this as i often wondered if i was getting extra charges - it makes sense though and they're just covering their end to make sure you have the $'s to cover the ride.

i've been using lyft for three weeks now (mainly to get to work during the cold weather) and i'm sad to report that everyday has been an ordeal using lyft!!!  uber is soooo much better and the drivers seem more knowledgeable in terms of street smarts and navigation.

here is a summary of the problems i've encountered with lyft:

1) drivers, while nice, are not great drivers and cannot navigate (even with a gps).  i had one driver turn from a middle lane and otherwise drive awfully, one driver who didn't even know where se was and another driver who didn't even know what the difference was between car pool and single passenger service (i had to explain it to him!)

2) car pool sucks!  i tried car pool and first, it takes 10 minutes for them to pick you up and then they drove (in my case, about 4-5 miles out of my way in the opposite direction) to pick up the other person (who was late!!!) and then drops her off in (i'm going to se - could she be even further out of my way?!??).  then the driver doesn't know how to use the lyft app and ends up driving us back to the office building in georgetown (where the other girl got off) as our ""next stop.""  when i told him that my address was in se, he didn't know how to use his own gps.  he kept turning on pa avenue rather than k street.  we ended looped around the same block three times (during rush hour traffic, pedestrians and lights adding over 15 minutes to my trip) before he finally listened to me that he was making the wrong turn each time!  my otherwise 15 minute commute to work took over 55 minutes!!!

3) one morning, the driver's eta was ""2 minutes.""  well after 8 minutes, i could see on my app that the driver never moved the car and no progress was made to come to my home. yet the app still said she was ""2 minutes away.""  i cancelled my ride because at this point i was late to work and they had the audacity to charge me a $5 cancellation fee when their own software could have told them that their driver never moved her car to even try and pick me up!

4) the way they apply credits towards rides is a total rip off.  in short, i had a few credits on my account.  one $10 credit expiring tomorrow and one $20 credit (for referring a friend to lyft - big mistake) that expired a month from now.  well the geniuses at lyft and their app, used my $20 credit this morning for a $12 trip instead of applying the $10 credit that expires tomorrow even though there is nothing in their policies explaining the logic and method for applying credit.   after multiple backs and forth with lyft, telling them that their app was faulty, irrational and defies commonsense, they refuse to return my $20 credit.  basically, now i'm stuck with a credit that expires in less than 14 hours while they wasted my $20 credit for a $12 trip (so i lose $8 in credit).  stupid!!!!

i only had $36 dollars and told the driver that i could give him $36 or even drive to him and give him the $36, and he started acting really shady. i then repeatedly told the drive i just really want my phone back and will give him the money, and he continued to be shady. i then resorted to saying that i would hate to have to report him but if he does not give my phone back that i would have too. he said  ""okay report me i'm keeping your phone"" i tried to calm him down  and say i'm not going to report you but will have to resort to it if he refuses to give my phone back and said i'd  give him $50. he then hung up the phone. after calling 3 more times  he picks  up  and says immediately ""report me your phone is mine now.  i'm  keeping it"" and  hangs up.... i'm speechless at this point. the guy ended up blocking my friends number and any number  i tried to contact him with...

two days later lyft emailed me stating the driver reported damage and the cost would be $150.00 which would be taken from my account in two days.  i told lyft i was innocent and had no idea what they were talking about and did not see photos of the damage ""which they said were attached"" to the email. 

they replied with photos and it looked like someone ""threw up"" on the back door and seat on the left side.  i sat on the right side and did not see or do this.  they said they reopened the case and decided to follow through with the claim.  after no help through this email exchange i emailed lyft through there website and was told to contact a ""specialist"", which i did thorugh email and he said he was sorry and would send it over to hq and someone would get in touch with me soon.

then i try to remove my card info from the site, since i knew i'd already been charged, i can't do it. so i consult google, do what the company told others to do. they sent an email saying nobody checks that email anymore. so i go to my bank online and it says lyft has my card on hold...

not even 1 minute after sitting down, the driver told me about his uncle marrying an asian woman. to dissuade him of any ideas, i immediately told him i'm lesbian. but he continued on, telling me i need a man because a man is different. he said he's a very good lover and that i should try him sometime. what bothers me the most is this statement, ""maybe i visit you sometime"" this guy is about to take me home and he would know my address. it is more than a little creepy. i picked up a lot of merchandise from sears that night, my phone is dead so i couldn't very well walk home. i had him drop me off 2 blocks away from my home so he wouldn't know where exactly i live. 

i got home and saw on my email my receipt, it was for over 5 miles so i was also overcharged. i immediately complained to lyft and told them exactly about my experience. two days later, i got a revised receipt with them knocking off $5 dollars off the fare and no other mention of all my other complaints. this is more than very disappointing. to be fair, this is my only negative experience so far but it is appalling how lyft did not care about passenger safety.

2. very user-friendly, transparent, very easy and comfy to use
3. you see the rating of the driver/passenger, you are safe, you get a ride which is pleasant and fun overall, basically you don't have to look for passengers - they find you and most of times already ready to go when you arrive. plus you explore the city, meet a lot of interesting people and you get to choose when you drive - you create the schedule that works best for you.",2014-01-27,5,Lyft,

the bad part about being a driver is the compensation.  there are times when i wont have a lyft for an hour, and i was unable to do anything else in anticipation for getting a request.  it was essentially an hour wasted (with no pay).  if there was a system where we could also get paid hourly, that would be optimal.  alternatively, get partial reimbursement for gas.  

all-in-all, my experience has been good.  i hope to continue lyfting for a while, in whatever city life takes me! :)",2014-01-27,3,Lyft,
