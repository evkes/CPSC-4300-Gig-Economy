i would have agreed to the driver cancellation fee if the driver moved in my direction. my driver stayed parked.
the fee is collected for drivers that are en route to the destination, not drivers who stayed parked. technically and legally i was charged wrongly. technology can track drivers' movements and only charge if the driver in route.
i feel scammed.
i was forced to look for another ride because this one did not attempt to come.

in addition, when uber says ""agree to this ride,"" i agreed to be picked up in 6 min as stated.
if the car is en route and takes longer than 6 min, even because of natural causes, then you are in default of our contract.
you​'​ re misleading customers with false time expectations.
this is false advertising. you are tricking them into agreeing to ride based on false data. false advertising is criminal.

it is also severely unethical to not have a customer support line when people are at riding with strangers you hire from the web.

i expect the fee to be refunded. please take care of this corrupt business practice appropriately and inform me of the steps you took to ensure the protection of other riders.

i feel like this story needs to be shared with the public. i will research lawsuits against uber's unfair business practices and join the mission and help others join.

uber. do better.

in addition to the criminal acts reported here, i feel there are more scandalous crimes within your company by c- bosses who benefit from underpaying, exploiting, embezzling, and using company resources for personal gain.

these pyramid business models are dying, and every c-boss will have to pay his spiritual debts.
they will not be allowed in the kingdoms of higher souls. they will not ascend. they will be left behind and not join the others around them are awakening and ascending.

they will remain on earth forced to learn painful lessons until their karma is finally balanced.

justice is always served.

i promptly cleaned up the mess. there was no spills, stain on the seats. there was some water leakage from the grocery bag which was sitting on the all weather mat. the car had a camera to record passenger activity.
few days later, a charge appeared on my card. i reached out to customer service and was replied that it was because of the mess that happened in the car. i explained everything that i have mentioned above and then also asked for the video footage to check if i have missed anything. i owned up for the reason and agreed to pay some amount which i deam as sufficient to clean a all weather mat but i don't agree to pay $150.

i booked the ride 3 days in advance in order to go to the airport.

exactly 1 minute before the uber arrival, uber cancelled the ride with no explanation or further remedy.

fortunately, i contacted lyft and the driver was there in 5 minutes.

the driver drove us to the airport efficiently, effortlessly and seamlessly.

the most important issue is that there was no possible way of contacting uber except in the uber app that erased the potential trip entirely.

none of the options were doable due to the erased trip.

any company that gets so big that forgets how they got there is in on a
speedy road towards its demise.

uber will probably never see this however millions of people will.

lyft’s core values speak volumes.

“uplift others: take care of each other — no matter which seat you're sitting in. make it happen: own the work. focus on impact. reimagine what's possible.”

choose lyft!

1. i feel a victim of a crime: what uber has done should be illegal in my eyes and would like to ask anyone if i can report them to anyone. basically been mugged.

2. i won't be using uber again and plead with others to do the same.

on the early hours of the 31st of december i had booked an uber. it was very busy with both people looking for taxis (customers) and taxis.

i booked an uber and waited a while before i was accepted a ride. it then said that the ride had been cancelled.

i booked a second ride and went towards where the car was. for all i know this may have been the first driver. when i saw the car and checked the number plate i said my name and he said no and put the window up. thanks sayyid!

it's very clear that these drivers were not wanting to miss out out on money and go 12 miles out to drop us off for such a low competitive fee. which is fine but i should not have been charged £11.50 for this. they took advantage, took the £5.75 each and picked others up - they were not at an inconvenience.

to further illustrate how horrid this company is, there were other uber drivers offering lifts cash in hand outside too which of course are uninsured lifts.

to add to this, i've not heard one word back from uber despite complaining hours after and providing a number and email address. i'm glad this has happened in a way because i now know that uber are not a legitimately ran company and have 0 ethics when it comes to treating their customers.

1) 3 cab driver's cancelled it after accepting the ride, saying that if you'll pay in cash then only we will come to pick you up or cancel by yourself
2) another driver who accepted the ride and came, was asking for toll charges (additionally) which he paid for routing from inside the ndls railway station.
3) 2 another cab driver's denied the ride after accepting the same saying that cancel it through uber and we will take you personally at the same price in cash.

total accepted bookings: 6, ride: none

under the section 178 in the motor vehicles act, 1988 all these acts are punishable and subject to penalty.

and this was not it, usually if i book uber in my day to day journey, then the fare shown at the time of booking and the fare deducted from my wallet/card always vary (on the higher side). why?

overall service quality was very good. uber ride service was very reliable apart from one incident where the driver wasn’t sure on location and took 40 minutes for a 10 minute ride. he also discussed certain religious and racial topics that made me uncomfortable.
but overall the ride service was very good. however the only issue we had was ordering food, we ordered from 2 local restaurants 2 nights and both times the food was cold on arrival, i could of walked to both restaurant locations if i knew the food would be cold on arrival.

i am always waiting at the correct pick up
i never make my driver wait
i never eat or drink in their vehicle

i always tip 20% (via the app)
i am always courteous and polite
i never slam my door
i always wear my seatbelt

it’s recently been brought to my attention that in south africa, if you don’t want your rating to drop drastically like mine has, you should tip — very very generously, at least upwards of 25% and it must always be cash. never via the app. it also helps if you offer to buy them takeaway.

essentially, if you are a tourist in south africa or a citizen such as myself, be prepared to *bribe* your driver extremely generously or risk your rating dropping drastically

uber south africa drivers generally score everyone a 3. this is based on the fact that they are frustrated with uber south africa not putting up their rates despite a substantial petrol increase in sa. so this affects their ""take-home"" pay

they mark your unresolved issue as resolved...well i am not going for it... i am going to wait until i get all of the help i requested and then i am canceling my account. this is too much drama and i am not going to deal with it...

i prefer to take the bus and prefer to call a cab since uber customer service and the company as a whole are so lazy, rarely respond, rarely assist properly and quick to mark things as resolved to make it harder for you to get back to them since a resolved complaint means you can't just reply anymore, you have to start over!

uber has a promo code on your account and they will never inform you about it. the promo code is giving 40% off your rides if you use a mastercard. i have a mastercard and used my visa for the last few months. had i known about this promo i would have used the other card and entered a promo code.
i found out about this yesterday 11/27/2022 and the promotion ends on 11/28/2022.

you have 30 days to request for your payment methods to be changed to mastercard.

my very last two trips, i was picked up from home and taken to my destination. i ordered an uber after and selected my home to go home. while in the uber the driver made the wrong turn and that is when she stated where she was taking me. i told her the app is wrong since and i am going home. the distance was shorter so the fee should be less.

i sent a message to uber and it was ignored. i sent another one and i was told that i need to wait until it's no longer pending.

what was that?
a lie, that is what it was!
so i needed two things,

1-the last trip fee to be corrected since the app gave incorrect information and my trip ended up being shorter. i still want the fee corrected.

2-i want to use my promo code to get 40% off up to $25. so that should cover my last 8 trips.

i requested for that in details and it was ignored.

i got an email saying that they can't do anything while the trips are still pending.

3 was still pending. not all...
i am trying to meet this expiration and uber is trying to waste my time until the promo expires.

i sent another message to tell them something they already knew. they saw other trips know longer pending. they ignored it and only spoke on the pending trips and marked the issues as resolved!

i sent another email for being ignored.

i received the next email and it showed the last trip which is still pending, fee also not corrected. it showed a refund. they then charged my mastercard.
didn't they say, they can't help if it's pending?????

i was lied too by uber for their pleasure and cheated for their gain. fraud!!!

the one they refunded was the last trip.
why not all 8 that i wanted and requested to be changed to m/c after the promo code is added.

they refunded the visa, didn't correct the fee, charged my m/c without adding the promo code.
why even change the payment method, if you are not going to use the promo code i clearly stated, that i wanted to use??????????
lord!!! yep, this is the drama, i can do without!!!

uber is useless since they hire clowns who doesn't want to work and have terrible attitudes...

i will be placing a complaint with bbb and my bank until i am assisted properly.
i will not let this go!

i hate poor customer service, it really burns me up! they may never get another order from me.
i am the type where i pay for good service and if i do not get it, i stop doing business with that company. that is how serious i am about great customer service!

if i have to fight for too long, i get angry and end accounts. when i am done, i am also done with uber. account will be closed.

these days, i am shutting down drama.
i refuse to support a company or agents to pay their bills, if i am being treated like crap in return. it doesn't work like that!
you cannot be ungrateful, i cannot be treated poorly and i will not be ignored!

Take note UBER,"this is dying, cancelled pickups, scheduled pick ups 6xtimes standard costs. really £45 for a 2 mile journey. no one who cares will see this i am sure and by the time they do it will be too late.

drivers have had enough and are going to bolt and others but worse than that is the customer experience which is getting so bad that i question whether the structure of uber as a business is failing.

lets hope they fix it. it was great but i guess when you were subsidising every journey with investor cash it would be. now the hard work begins i guess for uber !

for me its used less and less and the scheduling option which was an extra £2 for a journey is now an extra £30. really ! you are better off not offering it. its insulting and that drives me away ! literally !",2022-11-24,1,Uber,

the uber customers come last unlike how it’s supposed to be when customers come first for them when it comes to an issue.
latest terrible example with uber.
i booked a ride from airport. the driver brings me to the wrong place. isn’t it obvious that it has nothing to do with me, right? i had clearly indicated the address for my destination. uber app recognized my address of destination and calculated the $$ total for my ride.
now because driver needs to turn around, drive few more blocks to find my correct address, uber charges me extra fees for that, seriously???
moreover at the pick up place at the airport i’m waiting outside by the door where sign indicates ”uber”. then i receive a phone call from uber driver that he had arrived. he had stopped away from their uber sign and making me walk to his car with all my luggage. meanwhile i was walking to the uber car, apparently i had to pay for a “waiting” time. wouldn’t this be logical that i don’t have to pay that fee? i was the one who was waiting for the uber car in the perfect place, well indicted, designated for uber and then driver made me walk to his car instead of driving into that designated spot.
this is terrible!

of course i sent an email to the uber support. and what do they say?
because i had submitted claims for ride adjustments before and they think it was too frequent in the recent past they will refuse to adjust this ride.
guess what, every situation similar to this one that happened to me in the past, unfortunately was too frequent, they made me a victim of their bad service and multiple drivers errors. as a small business owner i care about my customers and they come first when it comes to service. i care about my customers and will provide the best solution for any error or negative experience which my business may have caused to the customer.
uber doesn’t care about their customers and would make them victims of their terrible service.
and they’re getting worst day by day!

after my reply to their support department with this same complaint, they send me this automated message which says that i am just not eligible for any adjustment because i have had price adjustments before. “eligible”? so when they make errors the customer needs to be eligible to receive a compensation for that?

he said ok to that and drove off. i waited and waited until he cancels but he never did. he parked his car on standby opposite my house for no reason and i went up to him with my dad to kindly ask him to cancel my trip so i don’t get charge and so that i can book another car. he said he didn’t have internet connection to cancel which was an absolute lie.

your driver was being really rude and shouted at me saying he already cancelled the trip when he clearly hasn’t because i could still see on my phone that the trip was still active. he lied and spoke to my step dad so rudely and nearly run him over with his car. absolutely disgusting behaviour.

after around 8 minutes of hanging around our house, he drove off and the trip was automatically cancelled and i was charged a cancellation fee of £6.62. this is an absolute utter bull**** as i never cancelled the trip and if he did cancel, he said i wouldn’t have gotten charged so i don’t know what the hell is this a cancellation charge is about. i later found out that this is because he received money when uber automatically cancels the trip after 8 minutes so it became quite clear why he was hanging around my house which was no way acceptable. uber took it that i never turned up for my trip despite me waiting and keep asking him to cancel the trip.

i then received a very snotty unpleasant email from uber customer service threatening to suspend my account if my behaviour continues. i’m sorry?

the driver clearly twisted and manipulated the whole situation and lied. before you come at me with such email, and only hearing his side of the story i would appreciate it if you email or phone me first to ask me what happens from my side. it is not acceptable to attack me with your unprofessional email, completely taking the driver’s side without speaking to me first. he was being completely rude and i am absolutely disgusted with the service i received today. i have used uber for years and years and never did i ever receive such disgrace of a service.

i would not be using you again as i do not appreciate to be treated like this. i would rather use a local taxi who respects me so much more than your company and drivers do. absolutely disgusting. i hope you change the way you work otherwise you will lose customers.",2022-10-13,1,Uber,

i have been trying to resolve an issue with the uber app which is actually incorrect with a destination, and i think the drivers know this as they do not ask until you are almost there. only to then say to you that this is the wrong place so you will have to put in a stop and a new destination. so 15-20mins later i arrive at my desired destination with an extra charge of around $25. was not happy at all.

emailed uber support, and explained very clearly my issue but after a $3-4 refund they no longer wish to talk with me and say that the matter is resolved.
it's not resolved because they don't or refuse to understand the issue.

i can't stand organisations that will not communicate and just treat the consumer with no respect at all. i don't mind the drivers, most are ok, a few wacko's but uber itself, just shocking.",2022-09-30,1,Uber,

their uber eats customer service is even more shocking. i was delivered a completely wrong order, i contacted uber eats with all of the photographic evidence and they still refused to refund me (therefore clearly not bothering to check my images and corroborating this with the order receipt to see the clear discrepancy). they say one thing but do another - their aim is to only steal your money. they’ll ask you to follow the processes to receive the correct resolution, but won’t stick to the same processes and circumvent around these and the issues, as well as make excuses to accept their responsibility in failures of their service to avoid refunding you. in simple words: they are thieves.

i was charged $10 for a driver cancelling my pickup minutes after i placed the order. i ordered a pickup from the international terminal tullamarine yesterday morning tuesday august 30 at 07:29.
i haven't used uber since 2019 and had trouble with the app and wasn""t familiar with the new uber pickup arrangement at tullamarine.
had i known all i needed to do was order a car curbside i wouldn't have tried to schedule a car for 08:15. it would have been more convenient for everyone.
i'm also sure the driver was able to pick up a fare seconds after cancelling my pick-up. mind you the driver ignored my request to be picked up at 08:15.
i don't see how the driver was inconvenienced and don't see why i should be charged $10 because it was ""more convenient"" for the driver already sitting in the pickup line.
i also didn't receive a code i could use with any car.

when trying to order an uber i was informed on the app there was an outstanding payment, which was odd because the money had been taken out of my account.
i called uber customer services 5 plus times and everytime i called they said the following
please hold the line for 2-3 minutes while we look into this issue.
and then after thanking me for holding the line they informed me they would need to raise this with the ""specialist team"" who you cannot phone because they have no direct line.
the response i recieved was that there were several instances of fraudulent behavior on my account and uber has a zero tolerance stand on this, which means my account has been ""restricted"" (cannot use uber for rides)
i have not been been given any example of fraudulent activity and the specialist team will no longer respond to my messages.
although the cs team were very polite they are all scripted to give the same reply and do not have any ability to help because ""they do not have access""
i can account for every fare, and i have been nothing but polite to every driver which is evident in my rating.
what a disgusting way of treating long term customers, accusing them of fraudulent activity and then saying we will not be replying to any further messages.",2022-08-10,1,Uber,

2. thursday august 4th. while driving my own car on a highway, i received a message that my driver had arrived at 1875 robson st.. i had never booked this ride. neither is the restaurant there nor anything else that concerns me. my wife tried to inform the driver and cancel. he only said we could cancel with the app, which we could not find. a second driver came a little later and we had the same game.

i was charged ca$5.25 twice for cancellations that were not my fault.

for approximately 3 weeks, uber customer support doggedly continued to contact the driver in an endeavour to get a response from him and, more importantly, arrange for the retrieval and return of my luggage. in the end we finally managed to get the contact information for where my luggage was being held, and the luggage was successfully retrieved.

the booking was accepted and confirmed but no car showed up, and from looking at the map on the app, there was zero cars available for miles! as it was evident that no uber was available, i cancelled the booking and was instantly charged the full amount.

foolishly i tried to book via the app, numerous cars showed as being available, but each accepted and then cancelled, so with time ticking by, i cancelled the request, and was charged again - even though there were no cars available!

i contacted uber to reclaim the £100+ that i had been charged - and was informed i would have to wait for them to decide whether they will refund!!!!!

why-oh-why does uber accept early morning advanced bookings, if they are unable to assign drivers - it’s unfair to put their clients under such levels of stress - especially when transport options are limited at 04:30 in the morning, and flights are involved.

what is even worse instead of apologising for the inconvenience uber charged me:

""to compensate drivers for the inconvenience, a fee is charged if the driver has to cancel after waiting for more than 5 minutes at your requested pickup location. to avoid this fee in the future, only request when you're ready to go.""

i cannot even dispute the fee because uber's sites constantly show me the follwong error for the last few hours:

so here's what happens - you launch the app, click on 'ride' and select where you are going etc. you see the price of the journey and agree to the booking. the app then connects you to the driver of your price choice, in this case it was £8.50.

the connection process takes forever and often does't connect, so naturally you assume that there is an issue with the app and cancel the connection. (i believe this is because the driver who uber is connecting you with isn't accepting the fare). you then start the booking process again only to find that the same car that had originally priced your joinery is now £16.50??? you also see a list of 2 other vehicles that have almost doubled in price too. how is it that within a few seconds of a booking the price can soar to almost double? clearly there is something going on here!",2022-07-08,1,Uber,

it seems that some vehicle owners drive themselves now because of this.

this service is still bad and i'm going to use a different provider. uber will never improve as they always leave a backdoor open for anyone to cancel 500m away from the pickup point so the driver can do a private pick-up. and you can't even review the driver as he never picked you up.

get home and i’ve been billed £339. the response when i called uber was the price was ‘updated for the average price in the area.’

nobody informed me of this and if this was the case i would’ve absolutely not got an uber home but probably an all inclusive holiday to spain for a week instead. they have referred it to the ‘specialist team’ but i’ve already been told they won’t be able to do anymore. we ordered an exec so nothing special.

i have already quoted on the app the same journey, at the same time on a friday night and the price still says £159.

not to mention the driver asked for my phone towards the end of the trip to ‘make sure there’s no extra costs’ and this happens. he has a dashcam so it will all be evidence unless he deletes it of course. he was driving at midnight with my phone in his hands. uber couldn’t give a damn about this either even though it’s a criminal offence to drive while using a phone. stupid me shouldn’t have handed it over.

absolute scammers and i am seeking legal advice to get some money back. i will take them to court of i need to.

what astonishes me is the point in uber was to create a community-based company that provided a service that was about the people - customer service, helping people get from a-to-b safely without ripping them off, and providing jobs where people could be in control of their own livelihood and working week.

on the return trip i wasn’t as fortunate. my friend said he was on the “ first floor” which i noted in the notes. i contacted my friend when the car arrived and saying he didn’t see anyone he said he was at the surgery center entrance, which i know from experience is on the lower level in the back of the building. i contacted the driver via message and asked that he drive around to the lower level entrance. i did not hear back from the driver and promptly received a notice of the ride being canceled, which i was charged for. the second attempt went better as i had the correct location from my friend.
up front i tried to explain in the notes about the situation so the drivers would understand it may take a few extra minutes for me to let my friend know they arrived so he would go outside to the car. i also apologized for any inconvenience and tipped generously.
i understand the second driver may not have understood english as well and possibly didn’t understand what i was asking. or it could have been for other reasons that he left.
it was unfortunate that i could not be in town to take my friend but i tried to make arrangements for him as best i could. you know the saying “ no good deed goes unpunished “. 😂 i don’t know how to improve the process for arranging rides for others but perhaps it could somehow be made simpler. this was all extremely time consuming for me communicating between my friend and the drivers. i hope this helps you in some way.

i contacted the support number who advised that my sign up date was december 2020 (when i looked at signing up but didn't complete the process) and that i was registered in mornington peninsula.

my drivers license, car registration and my national crime check that was supplied, all had my melbourne address so they have registered my city incorrectly.

my sign up date (according to the email sent in june of 2021, advising i could not sign up until my national crime check was completed) could not have been any earlier than the 12/02/2022 when this was completed and my uber account was activated.

i have called 25 times, had over 20 generic emails stating that my sign up date was 2020 and my city is registered as the mornington peninsula, i've had 3 promised phone calls from the escalations team and have had no answer as to why these details are incorrect, rendering my eligibility for the promotion, null and void.

the uber support line will not support you. you will be told it will be escalated and you will receive the same generic email every time. when you respond to the generic email, they send the same generic email again. this has been continuous for 10 days now with no resolution in sight.

be very weary about signing up to be a driver. they will do everything they can to avoid fixing mistakes or contacting you back. there is plenty more completion out there these days so i strongly suggest working elsewhere.

most attrocious, ugly service standard.
after travelling to more than 15 countries; i find to get an uber in delhi is at mercy of drivers. they will call to ask where to go, then disconnect, it's daily, every minute with every passenger in delhi at least. yesterday, i had to wait for exactly 27 minutes at the maurya hotel, delhi, with 8 cars cancelling my trip, finally no uber car came, i had to finally take a limousine.
at aiims, last week visited 3 times, waited for minimum 15 - 20 minutes each with multiple cancellations by uber. i could observe, many many patients, were suffering from uber refusals, desperate.
i can see it, feel it!! but, media houses don't have interest in these genuine situations.
i have never seen even in a 3rd world country where drivers call like goondas and decide to serve or not. elsewhere, they are not allowed to call customer to dictate terms.
but, only in india, they are privileged.
only in delhi: the cars are never cleaned, they are dusty, sticky dirts, interiors with no hygiene standards. you don't see that condition even in a poorer country.
what is the public awareness in delhi by higher educated demography people, where is voice of public???
we pay very high money, but, get treated so bad??
the uber customer service in delhi is deadlog, they are definitel nit doing job, for what they are paid by the company.

the first thing the driver did once i got into his car was ask me why my drop-off location was so far, basically insinuating that he might just cancel the ride on me. bearing in mind it is 9 pm and raining, i was feeling especially vulnerable. he reluctantly asked for a few more indications and sighed. i was already feeling uneasy. at about 10 minutes from the actual drop-off point, he said okay we've arrived. i was stunned. he was actually trying to drop me off much sooner in a very unsafe area while it was raining, at 9pm at night. i panicked and said, ""this is not the drop-off point sir please take me to the drop-off point.""

i was concerned as he reluctantly continued driving to the destination, obviously worried now that this man was just going to leave me wherever he felt like leaving me.

as soon as we arrived at the drop-off location he proceeded to overcharge me for the trip and although i protested i obliged to pay a little more.

to my surprise this narc reported after this entire ordeal that i had actually underpaid him, and i swiftly received an additional charge to my phone.

this man was willing to place my life in danger and yet not happy with that also decides he wanted to screw me over with the app as well..

what tipped me over the edge is when i was at home with my sister’s 3 week old baby (while she’s at work) and i ordered food for myself. the driver arrived at my house at 7:12pm (which was already late considering i ordered my food at around 5:35pm). i noticed he was just sitting there for a while, so i went outside and saw his car parked in front of our neighbours’ house. i approached the car to see if he was in the car and he was sitting there arguing with someone on the phone. i decided to go back inside and wait then at 7:21pm received an email notification saying my food had been delivered. when i went outside there was no food anywhere and the driver was gone.

i wanted lodge a complaint in writing with uber, but there’s no avenue for that on their stupid piece of s**t app. the automatic response on the app claims that i’m going to receive a refund for food not delivered, but i’d also like to be reimbursed for time wasted waiting around for this poor excuse for a driver (i have have very pleasant experiences in the past with the vast majority of their other drivers) who sat in his car for no reason and didn’t end up delivering my food anyway.

go ahead and find out for yourself and ask your driver next time. when uber came out, they said they would only take 25% of the fare.

if you read the articles written about uber and lyft, and it looks favorable in the reviews, they are the ones publishing it and putting it out on the search engines.

i will not use rideshare companies as often, knowing they lie about what they keep by an extra 30% difference. my drivers told me that they pick up around 10 to 15 rides per day and make around $150.00 per day working ten or more hours per day. that is not economically sustainable when less than 15% of the passengers tip them.

dear sirs,
i had a very terrible day. it started out with me going to work. the uber driver picked me up at 7:55am. then and he dropped me off a few minutes later because he said that he didn’t want to go that far and i was stranded in the middle of nowhere. he told me that he only had 30min to get to work so he left me miles from my destination. his license is above.

i am very unhappy with the situation because it caused me to get to work at a different time. i don’t deserve to pay for this route. when the route was reserved $60 was put on hold and i won’t get that for days which leaves me $60 short. i also believe i should get $100 credit for travel.

he should be fired.

you never drop anyone off until you get them to their destination especially if you have a problem with going that distance.

the customer service at uber were not helpful.

i called the first time when i was stranded they took my information and they said someone will text me or email me or message me back within 30 minutes. no one did so i kept calling back. i called back as many as seven times. they kept apologizing saying we’re sorry but there’s no one for you to talk to and that we can’t help you. i simply trying züngelt to work and you don’t have a method of helping people stranded except “we’re sorry and we will write a ticket” but in the moment i’m stranded and trying to get to work?!

it’s sad that your company was saying all we can do is write a ticket up for you and expedite it.

i was constantly promised that someone would contact me today.

no one did- this is a terrible system.

the first time i called they said that they make a ticket, the second time i called they said sorry we will make a ticket the third time i called they said sorry i will make a ticket the fourth time i called they transferred me to accounting the fifth time i called they transferred me someone they picked up the phone but never spoke.

it was a terrible experience for me today.

i need for you to please resolve this matter with me asap. thank you for your time and attention.

kindly

i used to love being an uber customer; prior to the pandemic.

i was fortunate enough (and very grateful) for being given $5, or up to 50% off some of my rides within the first 1 - 1 1/2 years of using uber. since march, 2020, i’ve noticed the offers slowly fade away. i no longer see any incentives like what i saw the first 1 - 1 1/2 years of being an uber customer.

the other day, i was running behind for work in the morning (i’m a healthcare worker), so didn’t think to double check the pricing before booking a ride. i just booked my ride to get to work as quickly as possible, where i would be arriving with no time to spare.

a ride that would regularly be between $19-21 cost me a little over $56 after taxes!

i’m not sure if these price increases are related to the pandemic or not, as uber claims it’s surge pricing.

i don’t understand how uber can get away with these prices. it doesn’t feel okay to me. however, i don’t drive, so my options are limited when i’m not able to take the bus.

i would highly recommend taking the lesser-known lyft ride service over uber when opportunity allows, as lyft seems more transparent with both their customers/drivers.",2021-11-28,2,Uber,

£12.71.....for 2 miles!!! a journey that would cost £5 with another taxi firm or 80p on the bus.
when i contacted customer services they told me 'that was the price.' it was because they put their prices up due to:
a) being short staffed of drivers and
b) to encourage more drivers to work
there was no option on the app to cancel the fare so in essence they could charge you whatever they wanted.
so not only was the pricing inaccurate to the app, it was also misleading and double the rate. as a result, and a point uber refuse to accept is, the customer is in fact the ones that are being ripped off as a direct result of them being short staffed. they have admitted that they had to raise their prices to encourage drivers to work.....but at the customers expense and slyly and without prior notification over the app.
if i went to a shop to buy a £6 top but when i got to the till i was charged £12, this would be misleading the customer and potentially in breach of advertising/pricing regulations. even so, as a customer, you wouldn't stand for it and demand to be reimbursed for the difference.
in this instance, uber claim to have done no wrong and stand by their decision to double the fare without notice, with no justification and will not offer a refund.
i feel their service is disgusting, underhand and extremely unprofessional. if they could only understand it from an oap's perspective. someone who doesn't understand technology or may be vulnerable or a little slow. this a clear violation and a target on innocent people. how many more people are going to get ripped off or overcharged and how many of those won't even notice??

i have used uber for years, i use it almost every day to get to work, however recently i have had the worst experiences ive ever had with any company.

one day i was taking a trip to work and the driver asked if he could take a call, and i said yes thinking he was going to use headphones or a handsfree device, instead, he picked up his phone to take the call. breaking to law in doing so. he then took the call, swerved all over the road and thought nothing of it. no apology, nothing. i reported this to uber and they gave me 47p credit as a result. 47p credit for their driver placing my life, and others in danger.

i decided to give benefit of the doubt, as i had never had an issue before and treat this as a one off.

this was until last week. i was away in another city for a gig staying at a friends house, we decided to get an uber back after the concert to save time as it was late, and there was a surge on, and the trip would be £25. this was steep, but understandable as it was late, so we went ahead with the journey. everything went well. we arrived back at my friends house and then the following day, when we were working out what time we got home, i referenced the uber journey to show the time which we got home, to find out that i had been charged £41, as the driver hadnt ended the trip when he dropped us off, instead he had driven back into the city centre, and only then ended the journey.
once again, i reported this to uber to try and get the £15 that i had been overcharged back, the driver refused to refund me, and so uber only issued the overcharged balance as a voucher.

dreadful customer service, take my money for no reason, and then refuse to give it back!

so, if you use uber, expect them to either try and kill you, or to steal your money.

then i discovered my ranking had gone down to 4.63 because one driver decided to give me a 1-star rating for no apparent reason. i referred it to their customer services and asked them to investigate it since it was clearly an outlier.

it matters because your rating can make the difference between getting a driver and not. this is a serious safety concern at the end of a night out.

they didn’t even bother to investigate it or establish a reason for such extreme negative feedback. all i got was a generic one-size-fits-all copy and paste from “mike” at customer services trying to justify their ratings system as fostering “trust” between drivers and customers. so “trustful” that they can’t even be bothered to investigate the problem.

well, now they can have a 1-star rating themselves. at least i can actually justify it, unlike their upholding of their driver’s malicious treatment of a good customer without explanation.

there are always better and cheaper local alternatives in your location, who probably also pay their drivers better.

i use cabs when i’m getting trains so i don’t miss them, otherwise i’d walk or get a bus. i’m often on a tight schedule and the whole point of using a cab is speed. so accurate and honest information is crucial.

consistently uber says 2-3 mins wait to be picked up, i accept it then says it’s connecting to a driver which can take 2-3 mins alone. then the timeframe moves back to 11 mins and keeps going up.

it’s so consistent it’s obvious this is no mistake but deliberately miss leading coding. as in they’ve got no drivers but want my fare, so give a misleading timeframe and give the bad news slowly hoping once committed i wont cancel because there is a penalty fare. it’s an extremely poor business model, it assumes the customer is stupid and won’t notice the dishonest and punitive way their being treated.

as i result i cancelled and found a local firm just but i ended up getting to station with literally minutes to spare. by the time i’d got a ticket, i had to run up and down flights of stairs, and down platforms with bags and literally got on the train as the doors were beeping. covered in sweat, stress levels up and very happy wasting best part of 6 precious minutes thanks to uber.

one driver accepted when there were still 12 minutes to the booked time. however, he was 7 minutes away and refused the ride. (i assumed because he did not want to wait 7 minutes)

uber notified me of “no available drivers in the area”, so, my pre-booked ride got cancelled and uber advised to start a normal search.

i started a normal search and a driver accepted it in a minute or less and he was only 1 minute away.

how funny is this?

the pre-booked ride was £12.00
the normal search was £22.00

isn’t this misleading a customer? i thought my ride would have been £12.00 and i was relax since i had a pre-booked driver to pick me up. instead, i had to pay more (£10.00 more) plus i had to hope a driver would have been available.

then i realised that there were plenty of drivers available - it was the price too cheap - why charge a customer £12.00 if you can charge £22.00? get him on-board with a cheap option first, then raise the price.

﻿i want people to understand the seriousness in the dangers of uber and their poor business model in aiding the trafficking of young girls in major metro areas.
my 14 year old daughter who looks young for her age ran away yesterday. she stole my cell phone, downloaded the uber app and hailed an uber car to a country, private, heavily wooded road with no houses. the uber driver picked up an obvious young minor with several backpacks on her in a wooded area, took her across county lines and dropped her off at a train station in a very urban area.
when detectives and police contacted uber to get any information on my missing child, they refused to cooperate or release any info on her ride, destination, pickup location or even what she was wearing.
the city she was dropped off in is a major child trafficking area and uber was careless, unsympathetic and uncooperative in helping locate my missing 14 year old daughter. when a child is missing, time is of the essence in a safe recovery and not only was uber uncooperative but also hindered our precious time in locating her.

i want everyone to be aware of this! i want uber’s policy to change regarding missing child investigations. there business priority should be the absolute safety of both passengers and drivers and that means being transparent when a child is missing with the help of a careless and improperly trained driver. their drivers should be highly trained to be able to discern at risk children and child trafficking signs.

i’ve reached out to uber and their official response refers back to their privacy policy. their website policy shows age verification required on all pickups and no riders under the age of 18 without an adult. obviously neither of these safety measures/policies were followed with my daughter.",2021-10-01,1,Uber,

on friday 27th august i ordered an uber from outside london to bring me home to london, the time was around 11.30 pm again i have used uber for this reason many times.
1. the ride was accepted, i waited at the usual pick up point.
the driver calls me from another place and complains i was wrong in my information, i told him politely this is the normal information i give and he complained for about four minutes, i told him please i am shattered and just want to get home.
he did not respond,i was saying hello about four times before i ended the call.
2. he did come to collect me, as soon as i got in the car he started complaining about the ride, that he should have cancelled the ride, no driver would take that journey this time of the night, i asked him to turn the music down he did not, this man went on and on trying to get a response from me, he then asked how many other drivers have cancelled on me,
i told none, this seemed to make him more angry,
3. i did not respond to him as felt he would be wicked enough to cancel the ride and why this time we were nearly on the motor way,
i believe he would have left me on some country lane.
4. so i endured the journey.
5. when we arrived at my destination i got out the car without saying a word, and when i got inside my home, i gave a review.

so you can imagine my surprise and anger when i received an email from uber that the driver reported i did not wear a mask for the whole journey, what a liar. i always where my mask,no one has ever had to request of me to put a mask on.

so if he can lie like this.
i know he would have left me on a country lane if i had responded to his rudeness all the way during the ride to my home.

then to top it all cannot respond directly to uber as there site will only let you respond to certain complaints.

am absolutely disgusted that someone can lie like this.
the first thing i do before i get on transport be it bus, train, taxi, uber is put mu mask on.

right ok so there’s an issue, then surely common sense would dictate tell the account homdef what the issue is so we can come to a solution and fix the problem!!’

so i’ve rung the only customer service number there is only 1 & having to repeat the situation about 4 times! so far and being told the same bs stuff !! with no resolve!

i don’t understand why there’s some secretive ‘problem’ with my account i’ve explained countless times and yet all i keep getting is generic messages that offer zero help or a solution then being told its with the elusive ‘escalation team which no one can speak too!

what kind of service is this ?! i’m the account holder and i’ve been using the same paypal and cards as my old account and yet your feeding me utter rubbish and sending me generic pointless messages that doesn’t explain or help the fact i can’t use my uber account! the amount of time wasted and frustration is a joke! fuming is an understatement! 😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡",2021-07-22,1,Uber,

i have not been able to find where in your help centre i can leave you feedback, hence replying here.

i have been notified of a report by one of your drivers that they cancelled a trip order because we were not wearing face masks. i am baffled at this person's audacity.

i placed several orders yesterday evening and those drivers never showed up, having cancelled on us way before getting to the pick-up point. all this time we were standing by the side of the road in open air, in an area where wearing a mask is not mandatory. had the respective driver bothered to show up, of course we would have put on our masks before getting into their car. but they never did, maybe because they determined that our trip wasn't worth the hassle or having found a more lucrative order.

i hope this clarifies the matter.

thank you,
dan damaschin

i had an important trip booked for this morning, scheduled well ahead of time. as usual, uber does not take any responsibility for their commitment to their users, and allow trips to be cancelled due to “no drivers being available”, right before they are scheduled - suggesting that you should “try requesting another trip”. as soon as you try this you will find there are in fact plenty of drivers available, but the price has now gone up at least 3 times the original price (in my case £26 instead of the original £6-8). this trip was only around 3 miles, which cost me £7 with a local taxi company, who were very grateful for the fare. once cancelled by uber, there is no record of the trip on your account, nor can you ask any questions or give any feedback. hence the surge of people taking to trustpilot and other review platforms to express their frustrations.

the issue here is uber take a large percentage of the fare, meaning they are going to be even more profitable if and when users accept this late minute hike in prices out of desperation, thanks to the last minute cancellation from uber. coming from a tech and business background, this ux would be a very straightforward fix, and absolutely well within uber’s power to change - and yet they still choose not to.

recently, they launched the hourly rate product.
uber claims that when a rider selects the hourly product, the rider is informed that the full set rate applies even if the trip is completed before end of the first hour.
this is so not true. i informed them about this and they just kept repeating same thing like a broken robot.
i even sent them a screenshot showing what riders see when hourly rate product is selected, and this information is not displayed.
they responded repeating the same lie and attached a link to how hourly rates are priced.
they hid this very vital information that fares for selected hours are non-adjustable/non-refundable in a link that doesn't even show up when riders make a request. so essentially, no rider sees the information on non-adjustable/non-refundable set fares except you go searching for pricing information beyond the fare displayed when you request a ride.

in this case, i selected 3 hours because i had 2 meetings which i expected to last for about 1 hour 30 minutes and lunch appointment for 30 minutes. factoring in transit time between locations, i figured, 3 hours should cover it. however, both my appointments were rescheduled when i got to those locations. so the trip ended up lasting for only 1 hour 40 minutes. uber charged me for the full 3 hours and the driver-partner left to do more trips for the unused portion of my 3 hours booking.
despite my appeleas, uber refused to adjust the fare to 2 hours rate (which is still more than the total time used, but i was willing to accept that). so i lost money on the trip. i also told them the information on non-refundable hourly rate fares is not displayed when hourly product is selected. all i said fell on the deaf ears of uber.

another incident:
in my current geographical location, many driver-partners complain when you do not use cash payment method, and unfortunately having change in this location is also very difficult. so i used to select cash payment. where the driver-partner doesn't have change, uber would credit my wallet with the change. however, i found out the hard way that uber puts a limit on the number of times you can request change be added to your uber wallet when you overpay with cash for a ride. so in this incident, i selected a cash payment due to circumstances beyond my control. the driver-partner did not have change. he asked me to contact uber support so the change will be credited to my uber wallet.
uber support said because they had credited my wallet with change for my one of my previous trips, they cannot give me change for this trip. i explained to them that it's different trips,different payments. none of the drivers were disputing my claim for change because they were all aware.
there was some back and forth with uber, but they just kept repeating the same thing. so i lost money on that ride as well.
till today, uber has failed to share a link to their policy on requesting change be credited to your wallet. riders are not informed of this when selecting cash payments. we only see a notice asking us to have exact fare. but in a location where exact fare in change is almost always impossible, we are forced to make bank transfers to the drivers bank account (provided there's network service) or look for change around or forfeit our change.

please, do your personal thorough research before you use any uber products/service. they have hidden unfair business practices and conditions that will drain your pockets as a rider. don't rely on uber or any of their driver-partners to disclose anything to you beforehand.",2021-06-19,1,Uber,

how are you going to say to me that my situation is not an emergency. you don't know what type of environment i mean where i'm at or if i'm in danger because you or she did not bother to ask because she was too busy reading from a script.
no one will ever contact me by email because i'm still waiting to be contacted about a non pickup about a year ago and i was charged $32.
i had to call for a second uber and was charged a different price even though it was to the same place because it said that it was during busy hours.

post covid , uber is desperate to revive its user base , which has grown overly used to not getting around too much… hence its offering discounts on its fares , quite a bit off,between 30 to 50% off based on how they rate you as a user.
that’s a very good deal.
my experience so far of uber drivers is that they are courteous and considerate. they have been hit hard in the pocket by the drop off in trade, and so far as i am concerned are deserving of support. they rely on tips, especially given the discounted prices, so my pov is be fair in tipping ( maybe even a trifle generous? )
my one quibble so far is the “location”function on the app. it really doesn’t work too well in my experience.

i have tried to get in contact with uber's customer service since march of this year(!). i have a pending payment on my account, which does not allow me to order food or taxis. the money has already been paid out from my bank - the money is gone - but the payment is still pending. i even tried to pay it again but i can't do that either, it doesn't process the payment on the website or in the app. obviously, i do not want to pay for this twice, but at least i tried to solve this on my own.

i reached out to uber on facebook, since it was so hard to find a way to contact their support on the app or on their website. finally, i was able to send a request, i got an answer from a robot in the next 48 hours and i replied and explain my issue again - no response. i waited for a week - no response. i wrote again - no response, i sent another reminder after a few days - no response. i wrote to uber again on facebook, they responded and asked me to have patience. so i waited, two weeks passed without any updates or responses. then i saw in the app that my case had been closed. so i reached out to uber on facebook again, since that's the only way to get a reply from them. they replied and said sorry and asked me to make another request, so i did that. i got a response within a week, i replied and explained my issue for the 4th time and they responded with ""we have technical issues with this atm, we will get back to you"". i answered this email again when a couple of days to a week had passed - no response. i waited two days and emailed again - no response. i informed uber on facebook that it has been two months since i contacted them for the first time without receiving any help or clarification. they just told me to be patient. i'm sorry but two months is being patient. now it has been four months since i first contacted uber to help me with this issue. apparently, users who want to use the app are not worth helping.

i work with customer support myself, so i know how it is in this business but i have never seen anything like this before. this is totally unacceptable for paying customers. their staff is obviously overworked and have no time for the incoming tickets.

i have used uber since the day they launched in sweden. i've never had any problems before, but as the company grew so fast the quality started lacking. i feel bad for all of the staff - customer support, drivers and food delivery people. all of them are underpaid and overworked. this is really showing to us customers now much more apparent than it did a couple of years ago.

(which i didn’t. we were never physical and i did not know this man) she then said he had to stay at my place and he refused to leave me alone. i told her to take him where ever because i don’t know that man. she made me venmo her money on top of tipping her and paying for the ride. i contacted uber and nothing happened.
second experience was just a month ago as well but with uber eats. i placed a priority order and they assigned me a kid on a bicycle. this boy went 3 miles the opposite direction of where the restaurant was. by the time he got to the restaurant, it was closed and then my order was canceled. i could not place another order because all restaurants were closed.
now my third and final experience with this company. i preordered an uber to the airport 4-5 days in advance. the time i was supposed to leave, my uber still wasn’t here. i am spending about $150 more now because this uber i order never showed up so i had to pay for one week of airport parking so i didn’t miss my flight. i could have also bought a cheaper flight if i would have know i would have been driving my car to the airport instead of waiting on my uber that never showed up.
i can’t even contact uber because they don’t have a phone number to contact at this time. cant leave the company a review on their site because it’s not offered online unless you want to rate your past trip.
save your money and take lyft. they are usually cheaper anyways. but because of not one but three terrible experiences, i will never give my money to this company again. and i spent a lot using them. btw, did you know they charge a lot more if there isn’t any cars “near” you. let’s not forget the surcharges they charge people on the most alcohol related occasions. this company was a great idea to keep customers safe from drinking and driving but they literally screw you over over and over again and profit from you trying to do the right thing by not driving.",2021-04-15,1,Uber,

we kept calling my phone and finally the uber driver answered. he said that he had just started his shift and didn't know when he could drop off my phone. i asked if i could request a ride from him so that he could put this in his schedule and drop off my phone but he said that even if a friend ordered a ride that he could not guarantee that it would be him who would get the ride. i thought that i would maybe find a way to contact uber to make the request for him ... but again there is no way to contact uber....

a few minutes passed and first thing that comes out of his mouth is “are you from here?” i wasn’t surprised lol
to what i replied “what do you mean from here?” you know like how can you tell i’m not? 🤷🏻‍♀️
we were able to have a good short conversation about the countries he had been to including mine and he ended up talking about venezuela and from there ramping about how this country is heading that way with dictatorship and socialism. at that moment i decided to just listen and not respond. he continued and mentioned moving to costa rica because of the socialism in this country. so as my trip is ending i said to him “good luck in costa rica, you have a great country here”. well because of my comment that let him know i guess that i’m a democrat and don’t agree with his views he added an extra $80 charge to my trip for “cleaning” because i caused a mess in his car.... so i ended up paying $92! now i’m worried about my safety as i see all the violent ways extremists have been acting lately and this man knows exactly where i live. of course i called uber made a report. i hope they solve this soon, give me my money back but still they cannot guarantee my safety. if anything happens to me or my family you all know who did it, i’m posting a picture of him and his info. talk about socialism and he practically just stole $80 from me just because i told him his, our country is great! so if you get in his car, do not talk about politics! i hope uber suspends him for the safety of all democrats that need an uber.",2021-01-14,1,Uber,
