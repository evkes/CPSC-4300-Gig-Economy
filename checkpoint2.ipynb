    "By: Janet Taylor & Evan Kessler\n",
    "\n",
    "Workers in the gig economy (i.e., Uber, GrubHub, TaskRabbit, etc.) depend on the reviews they get to continue working on the platform. Workers on those platforms are often affected by receiving negative reviews that describe elements that were not under their control. The project explores how the analysis of online reviews can detect when unfair reviews are left to workers and identify the type of unfair review that was left."

       "3                                                    my drivers were great, on time, comfortable people, clean, enjoyed the ride. i would've given 5 stars if the price had been reasonable. a 2 mile 5 minute ride should not cost $27 one way and add a tip!! geez!! then to get home. a reasonable fee would be $12 one way! if it was within my budget would use uber more often.\\r\\nattn corporate please reconsider pricing for seniors thank you\n",
